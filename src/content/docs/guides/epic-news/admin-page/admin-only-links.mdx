import MonsterKbd from 'src/components/MonsterKbd.astro'

## Objectives

In the [**previous guide**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/admin-page/protecting-routes), we learned how to protect routes in Remix by using the `loader` function to check if a user has the 'admin' role.

Now that we have protected the admin review page, we need to provide a link in the navbar to the admin review page only for users with the 'admin' role.

The problem is that our current function that checks the user's role throws an error if they are not an admin.

This wouldn't work in the case of a navbar link, as we still want users who are not admins to see the navbar but not the link.

This is actually a straightforward fix, and we will do this in a single step.

## Conditionally render the admin link

Open `app/components/organisms/HeaderWithSearch.tsx`.

Add the following code to the `HeaderWithSearch` component:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/components/organisms/HeaderWithSearch.tsx" showLineNumbers collapse={1-6, 39-51, 54-57}
import { Link, useMatches } from 'react-router'
import { SearchBar } from '#app/components/search-bar.tsx'
import { Button } from '#app/components/ui/button.tsx'
import { UserDropdown } from '#app/components/user-dropdown.tsx'
import { useOptionalUser } from '#app/utils/user.ts'
import logo from '~/assets/svg/epic-news-sample-logo.svg'

export default function HeaderWithSearch() {
	const matches = useMatches()
	const isOnSearchPage = matches.find(m => m.id === 'routes/users+/index')
	const searchBar = isOnSearchPage ? null : <SearchBar status="idle" />
	const user = useOptionalUser()
+	const isAdminUser = user ? userHasRole(user, 'admin') : false

	return (
		<header className="bg-emerald-50 py-6 dark:bg-emerald-950">
			<nav className="container flex flex-wrap items-center justify-between gap-4 sm:flex-nowrap md:gap-8">
				<Link to="/" className="group">
					<div className="flex items-center gap-4 transition group-hover:opacity-80">
						<img src={logo} alt="Epic News Logo" className="w-16" />
						<span className="text-sm font-bold text-foreground">Epic News</span>
					</div>
				</Link>
				<div className="flex flex-1 items-center justify-center gap-8">
+					{isAdminUser && (
+						<Link
+							to="/admin-review"
+							className="rounded-lg bg-green-900 px-4 py-2 text-sm font-semibold text-foreground transition hover:bg-green-800"
+						>
+							Admin Review
+						</Link>
+					)}
					<Link
						to="/news"
						className="text-sm font-semibold text-foreground transition hover:text-foreground/80"
					>
						News
					</Link>
					<Link
						to="/about-us"
						prefetch="intent"
						className="text-sm font-semibold text-foreground transition hover:text-foreground/80"
					>
						About us
					</Link>
					<Link
						to="/contact-us"
						className="text-sm font-semibold text-foreground transition hover:text-foreground/80"
					>
						Contact us
					</Link>
				</div>
				<div className="ml-auto hidden max-w-sm flex-1 sm:block">
					{searchBar}
				</div>
				<div className="flex items-center gap-10">
					<LoginOrUserDropdown />
				</div>
				<div className="block w-full sm:hidden">{searchBar}</div>
			</nav>
		</header>
	)
}
```

### What is happening here?

The Epic Stack provides a could of handy hooks to check if a user is logged in and what role they have.

Firstly, we are using the `useOptionalUser` hook to check if a user is logged in. If they are, we are storing their user data in the `user` variable.

```tsx
const isAdminUser = user ? userHasRole(user, 'admin') : false
```

We then call the `userHasRole` function to check if they have the 'admin' role. If they do, we can render the admin link in the navbar. If they don't, or if they are not logged in at all, we are not rendering the admin link.

```tsx
{isAdminUser && (
	<Link
		to="/admin-review"
		className="rounded-lg bg-green-900 px-4 py-2 text-sm font-semibold text-foreground transition hover:bg-green-800"
	>
		Admin Review
	</Link>
)}
```

### Testing - admin user login

Whilst logged in as a normal user, or when not logged in at all, you should not be able to see the new admin link in the navbar:

![Navbar without admin link](src/assets/webp/epic-news/navbar-without-admin-link.webp)

Now, log out of the application completely.

Once successfully logged out, log back in with the following details:

**Username**: <MonsterKbd>kody</MonsterKbd>
**Password**: <MonsterKbd>kodylovesyou</MonsterKbd>

:::note

<MonsterKbd>kody</MonsterKbd> is a default admin user that is set up in the `prisma/seed.ts` file.

:::

Once you are logged in as 'Kody', you should now see the "Admin Review" link has now appeared in the navbar:

![Navbar with admin link](src/assets/webp/epic-news/navbar-with-admin-link.webp)

Click on this link, and you should be taken straight to the admin review page.

:::tip[Challenge]

You will notice that the admin link is not in line with the other links in the navbar:

![Align navbar links](src/assets/webp/epic-news/admin-only-links/align-navbar-links.webp)

Can you style the admin links so that they are in line with the other links?

## Summary

In this tutorial, we have:

- Created an optional admin user check in the `loader` function.
- Added an admin link to the navbar that is only visible to users with the 'admin' role.

## ðŸ“„ Assignment documentation

Update your assignment to include explanations of the following:

- Why could we not use any existing functions to check if a user is an admin?
- How did we check that a user was logged in, and that the user was an admin?
- What is conditional rendering? How does the `isAdminUser` prop help us to conditionally render the admin link in the navbar?
