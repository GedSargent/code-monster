## Introduction

Now that we have routing set up, we need a way to secure our application.

We will start by adding cross-site request forgery CSRF protection to our application.

:::note[CSRF Deep Dive]

## What is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)?

[**Cross-Site Request Forgery**](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf), often abbreviated as CSRF, is a type of cyber attack that tricks a user into performing actions they didn't intend to do on a web app where they are currently authenticated.

### How does it work?

Imagine you log into your bank account to check your balance.

![CSRF 01](src/assets/png/epic-news/csrf-01.png)

While you are logged in, you receive an email from who you think is a friend. It has a link to a funny cat video.

You love funny cat videos (who doesn't??), so you click on the link and watch the video. It really is hilarious.

![CSRF 03](src/assets/png/epic-news/csrf-03.png)

***Here's the critical part***.

Because you are already logged into your bank account, the bank's website trusts that any requests made during this session are genuinely from you.

However, hidden in the email link was also a request to transfer money from your account to the attacker.

![CSRF 04](src/assets/png/epic-news/csrf-04.png)

Because the bank's website sees you are logged in, it goes ahead and authorises the transaction.

When you return to look at your balance, you see that your money has been lost.

## How can we protect against CSRF?

One way to protect against CSRF attacks is to use a CSRF token.

This is a unique string that is generated for each user session and is sent with each request to the server.

Before processing any request, the server checks that the token is valid and that it matches the user's session. If it doesn't, the request is rejected.

Let's add this now.

## Wrapping the application with extra security

Luckily, adding CSRF protection to our application is straightforward.

Firstly, add the following import to the top of the file:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/root.tsx"
import { type LinksFunction } from '@remix-run/node'
import Document from '~/components/shared-layout/Document'
import { useNonce } from '~/utils/nonce-provider.ts'
import rootLinkElements from '~/utils/providers/rootLinkElements'
import HeaderWithSearch from './components/organisms/HeaderWithSearch'
import FooterMenuRight from './components/organisms/Footer/FooterMenuRight'
import ThemeSwitch from './components/shared-layout/ThemeSwitch.tsx'
import { loader } from './__root.server.tsx'
import { Outlet, useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
import useTheme from './hooks/useTheme.tsx'
+import { AuthenticityTokenProvider } from 'remix-utils/csrf/react'
```

We simply need to wrap our application with this `AuthenticityTokenProvider` to ensure that a valid CSRF token is checked for every request across the entire application.

This is done by wrapping the components in the `App` component with the `AuthenticityTokenProvider`, then passing a `csrfToken` from the `data` object to the `AuthenticityTokenProvider` component.:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/root.tsx"
export default function App() {
	const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
	const nonce = useNonce()
	const theme = useTheme()

	useToast(data.toast)

	return (
+		<AuthenticityTokenProvider token={data.csrfToken}>
			<Document nonce={nonce} theme={theme}>
				<div className="flex h-screen flex-col justify-between">
					<HeaderWithSearch />

					<div className="flex-1">
						<Outlet />
					</div>

					<div className="container flex justify-between pb-5">
						<ThemeSwitch userPreference={data.requestInfo.userPrefs.theme} />
					</div>

				<FooterMenuRight />
				</div>
			</Document>
+		</AuthenticityTokenProvider>
	)
}
```

As you can see, we pass in the `csrfToken` from the `data` object that is provided by our `loader` function to the `AuthenticityTokenProvider` component directly.

Before moving on to the next step, make sure you rearrange the imports at the top of the `app/root.tsx` file by using the VS Code keyboard shortcut <MonsterKbd>SHIFT + ALT + O</MonsterKbd> (Windows) or <MonsterKbd>SHIFT + OPT + O</MonsterKbd> (Mac)

## Summary

Although not much has changed visually, we've added a strong security feature to our application that is crucial for you to write about in your assignment.

## Next steps

In the next step, we will secure our application against spambots by adding a 'honeypot' field to our forms.
