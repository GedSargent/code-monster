import MonsterReveal from "src/components/MonsterReveal.astro";

## Objectives

In our [**previous tutorial**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/displaying-articles/loading-dummy-articles), we loaded dummy articles in a `loader` function and passed them to the page component.

In this tutorial, we will:

1. Display information from the server on the page.
2. Access individual items from an array.
3. Use object destructuring to simplify our code.
4. Style a dummy article card ready for display on the page.

Let's get started!

## Display information on screen

Take a closer look at the **structure** of the mock articles we have created by expanding the first element of our `articles` array in your browser console.

You should see something like this:

### Mock article stucture

![Mock article structure](src/assets/png/epic-news/mock-article-structure.png)

The first mock article, found at index `0` of the `articles` array, has several properties that we can display on screen.

For example, it has:

- a `category` of `"technology"`
- a `title` of `"Article 1"`
- an `image` value of `"https://picsum.photos/800/600"`

Let's capture this first mock article in a variable so that we can experiment with accessing the properties it contains.

Add the code below to the `NewsCategoryPage` component:

:::caution

Although we are still inside `app/routes/news.$category.tsx`, note that we have jumped into the `NewsCategoryPage` component in the code snippet below.

As always, take extra care to ensure you are adding the code to the correct place in your file.

:::

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.$category.tsx"
export default function NewsCategoryPage() {
	const { categoryTitle, articles } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

	console.log({ categoryTitle, articles })

+	const firstArticle = articles[0]

  // [... Code omitted for brevity ...]
}
```
:::note

### Capturing an item from an array

Notice how we captured the first item from the `articles` array with square brackets `[]` and the index `0`?

```tsx
const firstArticle = articles[0]
```

If we wanted to access the second item in the array, we would use `articles[1]`, the third item would be `articles[2]` and so on.

This is how you access an individual array item in JavaScript.

:::

## Display the first article

Finally, let's display the first article's `title`, `image` and `category` on the page.

For now, place the code highlighted in green below just after the `<h2>` tag in the `NewsCategoryPage` component. We will style it later:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.$category.tsx"
export default function NewsCategoryPage() {
	const { categoryTitle, articles } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

	console.log({ categoryTitle, articles })

	const firstArticle = articles[0]

  	return (
		<div className="container py-8 lg:py-16">
			<h2 className="mb-16 text-h2">{categoryTitle}</h2>

+			<div>
+				<img src={firstArticle.image} alt={firstArticle.title} />
+				<h3>{firstArticle.title}</h3>
+				<span>{firstArticle.category}</span>
+			</div>
		</div>
	)
}

```
With this code saved, visit your `/news` page in the browser, and click on a category (it doesn't matted which at this stage).

Your `news/$category` should look something like this:

:::caution[Different images]

Your own dummy article image is likely different from that shown below.

This is because we are using a dummy placeholder image that is generated at random from a site called [**Lorem Picsum**](https://picsum.photos/).

If you refresh your page, you should see a different image each time!

We will soon be swapping these placeholder images for real images from the database.

## JavaScript object destructuring

Having to write out the variable name `firstArticle` every time we want to access its properties is a bit verbose:

```tsx mark="firstArticle."
<div>
	<img src={firstArticle.image} alt={firstArticle.title} />
	<h3>{firstArticle.title}</h3>
	<span>{firstArticle.category}</span>
</div>
```

Imagine if we had an object with fifty or sixty properties! We would have to write `firstArticle` every time we wanted to access one of them.

We can simplify this by using JavaScript [**object destructuring**](https://vinodht.medium.com/javascript-object-destructing-cheat-sheet-66dedfdc412).

:::tip[Challenge]

### Simplify code with object destructuring

1. Can you simplify the code by using [**object destructuring**](https://vinodht.medium.com/javascript-object-destructing-cheat-sheet-66dedfdc412) to extract the `title`, `image` and `category` properties from the `firstArticle` object?

2. After destructuring each property, replace all the `firstArticle` references with direct property names.

    For example, instead of writing:

		```tsx
		<img src={firstArticle.image} alt={firstArticle.title} />
		```

		you should be able to write:

		```tsx
		<img src={image} alt={title} />
		```

		Try it out yourself, then check your solution against the one below.

<MonsterReveal>

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.$category.tsx" ins="{image}" ins="{title}" ins="{category}"
export default function NewsCategoryPage() {
	const { categoryTitle, articles } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

	console.log({ categoryTitle, articles })

-	const firstArticle = articles[0]
+	const { image, title } = articles[0]

	return (
		<div className="container py-8 lg:py-16">
			<h2 className="mb-16 text-h2">{categoryTitle}</h2>

			<div>
				<img src={image} alt={title} />
				<h3>{title}</h3>
				<span>{categoryTitle}</span>
			</div>
		</div>
	)
}
```

</MonsterReveal>

### The initial article display

If you've followed the steps correctly, you should see the first article's image, title and category displayed on the page:

![Displaying the first article](src/assets/png/epic-news/displaying-first-article.png)

Although this does the job, it still doesn't look all that great!

Let's wrap the article in a parent `div` that applies the `grid` class to organise its children. This will allow us to style the article more effectively.

:::caution[Using your existing code]

If you completed the [**previous challenge**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/routing/use-loader-data#-challenge) a few sections back, you may already have a `grid` layout in place.

If so, you can place the article card JSX code into the existing `grid` layout and adjust the steps accordingly.

Otherwise, if you'd prefer to just follow the steps below, that's fine too!

:::

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.$category.tsx"
export default function NewsCategoryPage() {
	const { categoryTitle, articles } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

	console.log({ categoryTitle, articles })

	const { image, title } = articles[0]

	return (
		<div className="container py-8 lg:py-16">
			<h2 className="mb-16 text-h2">{categoryTitle}</h2>

+			<div className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-6 md:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-3">
				<div>
					<img src={image} alt={title} />
					<h3>{title}</h3>

					<span>{categoryTitle}</span>
				</div>
+			</div>
		</div>
	)
}
```

This already gives us a more organised layout for our article:

![Organised article layout](src/assets/png/epic-news/organised-article-layout.png)

:::tip[Challenge]

### Style the article card

Now that we have the article wrapped inside a `grid` layout, let's style the article card to make it look more presentable.

Using Tailwind's utility classes, see if you can recreate the card layout shown below.

### Tips

- The correct Tailwind height class of the image and text area are shown below in the reference image.

		![Styled article card](src/assets/png/epic-news/styled-article-card.png)

- The colours used in the bottom half of the card are customised, and defined in the `app/utils/tailwind/extended-theme.ts` file. They are responsive to both light and dark themes. These include:
		- The background colour, which is `bg-card dark:bg-dark-card`.
		- The text colour of the heading, which is `text-foreground dark:text-dark-foreground`.
		- The text colour of the category label, which is `text-muted-foreground dark:text-dark-muted-foreground`.
		- You'll notice there is an icon next to the category label. This is a custom icon that you can find in OneNote under the "**üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª - Components and props**" lesson resources. It is part of a collection of icons you can download in a zip file.

			Alternatively, the React-icons library is pre-installed in the project.

			You can explore how to use React-icons here: [**React-icons**](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).

Please note that your own solution will likely look different from the one shown below. As long as yours works, don't worry if it's not exactly the same!

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.$category.tsx" showLineNumbers collapse={1-3, 2-6}
import { invariant } from '@epic-web/invariant'
import { json, type LoaderFunctionArgs } from '@remix-run/node'
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
// Remember the file below needs adding to the project first!
+import techIcon from '~/assets/png/tech-logo@2x.png'

// ... Code omitted for brevity ...

export default function NewsCategoryPage() {
	const { categoryTitle, articles } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

	console.log({ categoryTitle, articles })

	const { image, title, category } = articles[0]

	return (
		<div className="container py-8 lg:py-16">
			<h2 className="mb-16 text-h2">{categoryTitle}</h2>

			<div className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-6 md:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-3">
+				<div>
+					<div className={`relative h-44 lg:h-52`}>
+						<div className="absolute inset-0 ">
+							<img
+								className="h-full w-full rounded-t-md object-cover"
+								src={image}
+								alt={title}
+							/>
+						</div>
+					</div>
+					<div
+						className={`flex h-40 flex-col justify-between rounded-b-md bg-muted p-6 lg:h-44`}
+					>
+						<h3 className={`line-clamp-2 text-2xl font-bold text-foreground`}>
+							{title}
+						</h3>
+						<div className="flex items-center gap-3">
+							<img src={techIcon} alt={categoryTitle} className="h-6 w-6" />
+							<span className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
+								{categoryTitle}
+							</span>
+						</div>
+					</div>
+				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	)
}
```

With this code saved, your news article card should look something like this:

## Summary

In this lesson, we learned how to:

- Display information from the server on the page.
- Access individual items from an array.
- Use object destructuring to simplify our code.
- Style a dummy article card ready for display on the page.

In the next lesson, we will learn how to create a reusable custom component from our styled article card, and loop through an array of articles to display them all.
