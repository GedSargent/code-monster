title: From 'dark' to 'light' mode
description: Understanding where light and dark mode is implemented in the Epic Stack, and how to manually switch between the two.
---

Allowing users to switch between a 'light' and 'dark' mode on your website is something most people expect from a modern web application. It also helps improve accessibility for the site, allowing users to settle on a theme that suits them best.

The only problem is that implementing a light and dark mode is surprisingly difficult. Luckily, the Epic Stack has most of the code for this already included.

All we need to do is implement it ðŸš€.

## Trigger 'light' and 'dark' mode with code

Open `app/root.tsx` and look carefully at the `App` function being exported:

```tsx title="app/root.tsx" {12-26} collapse={1-4}
import { type LinksFunction } from '@remix-run/node'
import Document from '~/components/shared-layout/Document.tsx'
import rootLinkElements from '~/utils/providers/rootLinkElements'
import { useNonce } from '~/utils/nonce-provider.ts'

export const links: LinksFunction = () => {
	return rootLinkElements
}
export { headers, meta } from './__root.client.tsx'
export { action, loader } from './__root.server.tsx'

export default function App() {
	const nonce = useNonce()

	return (
		<Document nonce={nonce} honeyProps={data?.honeyProps}>
			<div className="flex h-screen flex-col justify-between">
				<div className="flex-1">
					<main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
						<h1 className="text-mega">Welcome to Epic News!</h1>
					</main>
				</div>
			</div>
		</Document>
	)
}
```

:::note

Your `App` function probably looks a little different from this if you followed the [**'root-tsx file'**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/root-tsx) tutorial previously.

Don't worry, the fundamentals of this process remain the same.

### The `Document` component

Notice the `Document` component that wraps everything being returned from the `App` function?

```tsx title="app/root.tsx" collapse={6-10} {2, 16, 24}
import { type LinksFunction } from '@remix-run/node'
import Document from '~/components/shared-layout/Document.tsx'
import rootLinkElements from '~/utils/providers/rootLinkElements'
import { useNonce } from '~/utils/nonce-provider.ts'

export const links: LinksFunction = () => {
	return rootLinkElements
}
export { headers, meta } from './__root.client.tsx'
export { action, loader } from './__root.server.tsx'

export default function App() {
	const nonce = useNonce()

	return (
		<Document nonce={nonce} honeyProps={data?.honeyProps}>
			<div className="flex h-screen flex-col justify-between">
				<div className="flex-1">
					<main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
						<h1 className="text-mega">Welcome to Epic News!</h1>
					</main>
				</div>
			</div>
		</Document>
	)
}
```

Right-click the opening `Document` tag, and select '**Go to Source Definition**' from the option menu:

![Selecting Go to source definition](src/assets/png/image-20240211152140693.png)

This will open the file where the `Document` component code is held:

```tsx title="app/components/shared-layout/Document.tsx"
interface DocumentProps {
	children: React.ReactNode
	nonce: string
	theme?: Theme
	env?: Record<string, string>
	allowIndexing?: boolean
}

export default function Document({
	children,
	nonce,
	theme = 'dark',
	env = {},
	allowIndexing = true,
}: DocumentProps) {
	return (
		<html lang="en" className={`${theme} h-full overflow-x-hidden`}>
			<head>
				<ClientHintCheck nonce={nonce} />
				<Meta />
				<meta charSet="utf-8" />
				<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
				{allowIndexing ? null : (
					<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" />
				)}
				<Links />
			</head>
			<body className="bg-background text-foreground">
				{children}
				<script
					nonce={nonce}
					dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
						__html: `window.ENV = ${JSON.stringify(env)}`,
					}}
				/>
				<ScrollRestoration nonce={nonce} />
				<Scripts nonce={nonce} />
			</body>
		</html>
	)
}
```

### Interfaces, props and children

Let's take a moment to look at the code here.

#### Interfaces

At the top of the file is an `interface`. But what is it for?

In TypeScript, an [**interface**](https://prismic.io/blog/typescript-interfaces#:~:text=Interfaces%20are%20a%20feature%20of,type%2Drelated%20errors%20during%20development.) is like a blueprint for an object. It describes what [**properties**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_objects) an object should have and what type of data each property should hold.

Here is the `DocumentProps` interface:

```tsx
interface DocumentProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  nonce: string;
  theme?: Theme;
  env?: Record<string, string>;
	allowIndexing?: boolean
}
```

It's saying that any object we want to pass as a `DocumentProps` object should have the following properties:

- `children`: This should be a `React.ReactNode`. In simple terms, this means it can be any kind of item that React can render on the screen, like a component, a piece of text, or even nothing at all.

- `nonce`: This should be a `string`, which is a sequence of characters like "hello" or "1234".

:::caution

_In our app, a `nonce` is a unique string that's used to prevent [**cross-site scripting (XSS)**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting) attacks._

_We don't need to worry about this for now, but we will come back to it soon._

:::

- `theme`: This is an optional property (that's what the `?` means), and it should be of type `Theme`. We don't see a definition for `Theme` in this file, but it's being `import`ed at the top from the file `app/utils/theme.server.ts`:

  ```tsx
  import { Theme } from "~/utils/theme.server";
  ```

  If we open this file, we can see its definition:

  ```tsx
  export type Theme = "light" | "dark";
  ```

  This means that `Theme` must be one of two possible strings: `'light'` or `'dark'`. We'll be looking at this in more detail later.

- `env`: This is also optional, and it should be of the type `Record<string, string>`.

		This is a fancy way of saying it's an object where all the keys and values are strings. For example, `{ "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" }` would be a valid `env`.

- `allowIndexing`: This is also optional, and it should be of the type `boolean`.

		This is a flag that tells search engines like Google whether they should index the page or not. If `allowIndexing` is `true`, the page will be indexed. If it's `false`, the page won't be indexed.

So, if you have an object and you want to make sure it fits the `DocumentProps` blueprint, it needs to have these properties with these types.

#### Props

Remember that the `Document` function is a [**React component**](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component).

Because of this, it's a function that can take an object called `props` as an argument and returns some JSX.

Props are a way of passing data into a component from elsewhere in the codebase. In this case, the `Document` component is expecting an object that fits the `DocumentProps` interface.

Wherever we use the `Document` component, we _must_ pass it an object that has the properties `children` and `nonce`. The `theme`, `env` and `allowIndexing` properties are _optional_ - we can pass them if we want to, but we don't have to.

##### Refresher tutorial

If you need a refresher on props in React, check out the previous lesson on [**Props**](/code-monster/guides/react-101/props) in our React 101 section, or visit the [**React documentation**](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component).

#### Children

The `children` property is a special prop in React. It's used to pass any content between the opening and closing tags of a component.

In the example of the `Document` component, the `children` prop is used to pass in the content that should be rendered between the `<body>` tags of the HTML document.

```tsx title="app/components/shared-layout/Document.tsx" showLineNumbers collapse={1-11, 22-31} {14, 33}
import { Links, Meta, Scripts, ScrollRestoration } from '@remix-run/react'
import { ClientHintCheck } from '~/utils/client-hints'
import { Theme } from '~/utils/theme.server'

interface DocumentProps {
	children: React.ReactNode
	nonce: string
	theme?: Theme
	env?: Record<string, string>
	allowIndexing?: boolean
}

export default function Document({
	children,
	nonce,
	theme = 'dark',
	env = {},
	allowIndexing = true,
}: DocumentProps) {
	return (
		<html lang="en" className={`${theme} h-full overflow-x-hidden`}>
			<head>
				<ClientHintCheck nonce={nonce} />
				<Meta />
				<meta charSet="utf-8" />
				<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
				{allowIndexing ? null : (
					<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" />
				)}
				<Links />
			</head>
			<body className="bg-background text-foreground">
				{children}
				<script
					nonce={nonce}
					dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
						__html: `window.ENV = ${JSON.stringify(env)}`,
					}}
				/>
				<ScrollRestoration nonce={nonce} />
				<Scripts nonce={nonce} />
			</body>
		</html>
	)
}
```

This unassuming little prop actually does a lot of work behind the scenes. It's what allows us to nest components inside other components, and it's what makes React so powerful.

If you look back at the `App` function in `app/root.tsx`, you can see that the `Document` component is being used to wrap the content of the page:

```tsx title="app/root.tsx" collapse={6-10} {2, 16, 24}
import { type LinksFunction } from '@remix-run/node'
import Document from '~/components/shared-layout/Document.tsx'
import rootLinkElements from '~/utils/providers/rootLinkElements'
import { useNonce } from '~/utils/nonce-provider.ts'

export const links: LinksFunction = () => {
	return rootLinkElements
}
export { headers, meta } from './__root.client.tsx'
export { action, loader } from './__root.server.tsx'

export default function App() {
	const nonce = useNonce()

	return (
		<Document nonce={nonce} honeyProps={data?.honeyProps}>
			<div className="flex h-screen flex-col justify-between">
				<div className="flex-1">
					<main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
						<h1 className="text-mega">Welcome to Epic News!</h1>
					</main>
				</div>
			</div>
		</Document>
	)
}
```

Nesting components within each other like this is a common pattern in React. It allows us to build up complex user interfaces from lots of smaller building blocks.

## Manually updating from 'light' to 'dark' themes

Head back over to `app/components/shared-layout/Document.tsx` if you are not in it already.

Find the line that reads `theme = 'dark'`, around line 16.

Change this to `theme = 'light'` and save the file:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/components/shared-layout/Document.tsx" showLineNumbers startLineNumber={18}
export default function Document({
	children,
	nonce,
-	theme = 'dark',
+	theme = 'light',
	env = {},
}: DocumentProps)
```

You should see the website in the browser looks completely different:

![Project in Light Mode](src/assets/png/image-20240211162611565.png)

### Why? Tailwind classes and string interpolation

Take a closer look at the opening `html` component being returned from the `Document` function:

```tsx mark='${theme}' {4} showLineNumbers collapse={10-30}
export default function Document({
	children,
	nonce,
	theme = 'light',
	env = {},
	allowIndexing = true,
}: DocumentProps) {
	return (
		<html lang="en" className={`${theme} h-full overflow-x-hidden`}>
			<head>
				<ClientHintCheck nonce={nonce} />
				<Meta />
				<meta charSet="utf-8" />
				<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
				{allowIndexing ? null : (
					<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" />
				)}
				<Links />
			</head>
			<body className="bg-background text-foreground">
				{children}
				<script
					nonce={nonce}
					dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
						__html: `window.ENV = ${JSON.stringify(env)}`,
					}}
				/>
				<ScrollRestoration nonce={nonce} />
				<Scripts nonce={nonce} />
			</body>
		</html>
	)
}
```

Can you see how the value of the `theme` variable has been slotted into the `className` **property** (or '**prop**')?

This is called [**interpolation**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals), and is a way of inserting the value of a variable into a string in JavaScript.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we've learned:

- How to switch between 'light' and 'dark' themes in the Epic Stack.
- How to manually update the theme from 'dark' to 'light' in the `Document` component.
- How to use string interpolation to insert the value of a variable into a string.
- How to use TypeScript interfaces to define the shape of an object.
- How to use React props to pass data into a component.

## What's next?

What we need now is a way for **users** to control the value of `theme` dynamically from the front-end, so they can switch easily between both.

In our next tutorial, we add a button that users can click to toggle between the two states.
