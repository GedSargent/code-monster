## Frontend and backend code

In any given website, there are two main parts to the code that drives it:

1. **Frontend code**: This is the code that runs in the user's browser (the 'client'). It's written in JavaScript and is responsible for rendering the website and handling user interactions.

2. **Backend code**: This is the code that runs on the server. It's written in a server-side language like Node.js, Python, or Ruby, and is responsible for fetching data from a database, processing it, and sending it to the frontend.

In a traditional website, the frontend and backend code are separate and communicate with each other using HTTP requests. The frontend code makes a request to the backend code, which processes the request and sends back a response.

![Front and backend code](src/assets/gif/front-and-backend-code.gif)

In Remix, the frontend and backend code are combined into a single file called a **route module**. The file we have been working in - `root.tsx` - is an example of a route module.

This file contains both the frontend code (React components) and the backend code needed to render a particular page.

So far, we have been working exclusively on the frontend code. So where is the backend code? Let's take a look...

## The `loader` and `action` functions

Take another look at the `app/root.tsx` file:

```tsx title="app/root.tsx" showLineNumbers {13}
import { useLoaderData } from 'react-router'
import { type Route } from './+types/root.ts'
import { type loader } from './__root.server.tsx'
import { GeneralErrorBoundary } from './components/error-boundary.tsx'
import Document from './components/shared-layout/Document.tsx'
import { useNonce } from './utils/nonce-provider.ts'
import rootLinkElements from './utils/providers/rootLinkElements.ts'

export const links: Route.LinksFunction = () => {
	return rootLinkElements
}
export { meta } from './__root.client.tsx'
export { headers, loader } from './__root.server.tsx'

export default function App() {
	const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader | null>()
	const nonce = useNonce()

	return (
		<Document nonce={nonce} honeyProps={data?.honeyProps}>
			<div className="flex h-screen flex-col justify-between">
				<div className="flex-1">
					<main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
						<h1 className="text-mega">Welcome to Epic News!</h1>
					</main>
				</div>
			</div>
		</Document>
	)
}

export const ErrorBoundary = GeneralErrorBoundary
```

You'll notice that we are exporting a function from this file called: `loader`.

```tsx "loader"
export { headers, loader } from './__root.server.tsx'
```

This function is responsible for fetching data from the server and processing it before it is sent to the frontend.

But where is this function defined? The line highlighted above says that the `loader` function is being exported somehow, but we don't see them in this file. üßê

That's because it is defined in a completely separate file: `__root.server.tsx`.

:::note[Deep Dive]

### `import` and `export` statements

JavaScript allows us to split our code into multiple files and then `import` and `export` functions and variables between them.

This helps to keep our code organized and makes it much better to work with.

Having smaller, more focused files makes it easier for humans to understand what is going on in each part of the code.

That's precisely what the `import` statements are doing at the top of each file in the project, e.g.:

```tsx title="app/root.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { useLoaderData } from 'react-router'
import { type Route } from './+types/root.ts'
import { type loader } from './__root.server.tsx'
import { GeneralErrorBoundary } from './components/error-boundary.tsx'
import Document from './components/shared-layout/Document.tsx'
import { useNonce } from './utils/nonce-provider.ts'
import rootLinkElements from './utils/providers/rootLinkElements.ts'
```

Each `import` statement is bringing in a function or variable from another file, so that it can be used in the current file.

:::

If you are interested, open up the `__root.server.tsx` file and take a look at the `loader` function. You'll see that it is responsible for fetching data from the server and sending it to the frontend.

We will be looking more closely at the `loader` function in a later tutorial.

For now, we just need to get the data from the `loader` function into the frontend component. Let's see how we can do that...

## Adding `useLoaderData` to the `App` component

`useLoaderData` is a custom React [**hook**](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) supplied for us by Remix.

:::note

### What is a hook?

In React, a [**hook**](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks) is a function that lets you use state and other React features inside a function component.

In this case, [**`useLoaderData`**](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-loader-data) is a custom hook that Remix provides to us.

It allows us to access the data returned from the `loader` function running on the backend, and pass it into the frontend component.

At this stage, we don't need to worry about how it works, we just need to know that it returns the `data` from a `loader` function executed on the server.

:::

### Updating the `import` statements

Making sure you are still inside `app/root.tsx`, let's start by updating the `import` statements at the top of the file.

:::caution[Red and yellow lines]

### Errors and warnings in VS Code

When you paste the code below into your file, you may see some lines underlined in red and yellow:

![Red and yellow lines in VS Code](src/assets/png/epic-news/red-and-yellow-lines.png)

This is because:

1. We haven't used the values, variables and functions that we are importing yet, and VS Code is warning us about this.
2. VS Code expects the imports to be organised in a certain order, and we have added new imports that don't follow this order (yet).

You can see both of these warnings if you hover over the underlined code in VS Code.

Don't worry about these for now. We will be using these imports in the next steps, and we will organise them properly later on in the tutorial.

:::

Add the code highlighted in green to the end of your `import` statements in `app/root.tsx`:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/root.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { type LinksFunction } from '@remix-run/node'
import Document from '~/components/shared-layout/Document'
import { useNonce } from '~/utils/nonce-provider.ts'
import rootLinkElements from '~/utils/providers/rootLinkElements'
+import { ThemeSwitch, useTheme } from './routes/resources+/theme-switch.tsx'
```

Next, carefully add the code highlighted in green below to the `App` component function itself:

:::danger[Take care]

## üßê Place code **with care**

Look carefully where the highlighted code is added in relation to the code that is already there.

As you get more confident with JavaScript and Remix, you will learn where to place code like this more instinctively.

However, while you are finding your feet, _**take the time to slot these lines into <u>exactly</u> the same places in your own code**_.

:::

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/root.tsx" showLineNumbers ins=" theme={theme}" collapse={1-14}
import { useLoaderData } from 'react-router'
import { type Route } from './+types/root.ts'
import { type loader } from './__root.server.tsx'
import { GeneralErrorBoundary } from './components/error-boundary.tsx'
import Document from './components/shared-layout/Document.tsx'
import { useNonce } from './utils/nonce-provider.ts'
import rootLinkElements from './utils/providers/rootLinkElements.ts'
import { ThemeSwitch, useTheme } from './routes/resources+/theme-switch.tsx'

export const links: LinksFunction = () => {
	return rootLinkElements
}
export { meta } from './__root.client.tsx'
export { headers, loader } from './__root.server.tsx'

export default function App() {
	const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader | null>();
	const nonce = useNonce();
+	const theme = useTheme()

	return (
		<Document theme={theme} nonce={nonce} honeyProps={data?.honeyProps}>
			<div className="flex h-screen flex-col justify-between">
				<div className="flex-1">
					<main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
						<h1 className="text-mega">Welcome to Epic News!</h1>
					</main>
				</div>
+
+				<div className="container flex justify-between pb-5">
+					<ThemeSwitch userPreference={data?.requestInfo.userPrefs.theme} />
+				</div>
			</div>
		</Document>
	)
}
```

### Review your code

Take a few minutes to review the code you have added.

Can you can understand what it's doing?

Remember you can **<MonsterKbd>CTRL</MonsterKbd> + click** (or **<MonsterKbd>CMD</MonsterKbd> + click** on a Mac) on component names to open code you've imported from elsewhere.

When you are ready, open the explanation below.

<MonsterReveal title="Explanation ü§ì">
  <div>
    #### 1. `useLoaderData` and the `data` object

    ```tsx title="app/root.tsx"
    const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader | null>()
    ```

    The `useLoaderData` hook provides whatever value is returned from the `loader` function (which in this case we are importing from `app/__root.server.tsx`).

		Think of `useLoaderData` as a bridge connecting the server to the browser.

		Any code returned from `loader` that is generated on the server is captured and passed straight into the browser by this simple hook.

    So, the `data` variable here represents the object being returned from the `loader` function that we have imported from the `app/__root.client.tsx` file.

		A few lines down, we pass this into the `ThemeSwitch` component:

    ```tsx title="app/root.tsx" mark="data?.requestInfo.userPrefs.theme"
    <ThemeSwitch userPreference={data?.requestInfo.userPrefs.theme} />
    ```

    As you can probably guess, this particular bit of the `data` object contains the user's `theme` preferences (i.e. 'light' or 'dark'), and is read directly from a browser [**cookie**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies).

    #### 2. The `ThemeSwitch` component

    The `ThemeSwitch` component is simply an icon wrapped inside a Remix [form](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/components/form).

  </div>

## Testing the light and dark mode toggle button

Save your changes, then head back to the browser. You should now be able to toggle the theme between light and dark mode by clicking the button:

![Light and dark mode toggle button](src/assets/gif/theme-switch-toggle.gif)

## üéâ Congratulations! üéâ

You now have a working light and dark mode toggle button in your Remix app! üöÄ

## Automatically organise imports in VS Code

Finally, lets fix the yellow underlines that might still be showing under your new `import` statements.

As mentioned [**earlier**](#errors-and-warnings-in-vs-code), VS Code is warning us that we haven't used the values, variables and functions that we are importing yet.

Thankfully, VS Code provides us with a keyboard shortcut to automatically organise our imports in the correct order.

1. **Windows**: <MonsterKbd>SHIFT + ALT + O</MonsterKbd>
2. **Mac**: <MonsterKbd>SHIFT + OPTION + O</MonsterKbd>

Press this shortcut now to automatically organise your imports at the top of your file:

![Auto sort imports in root.tsx](src/assets/gif/auto-sort-imports-root-tsx.gif)

Remember to save your file after you have done this, and commit your changes to Git.
