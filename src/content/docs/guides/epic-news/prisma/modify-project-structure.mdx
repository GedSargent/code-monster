import { Icon, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import MonsterReveal from "src/components/MonsterReveal.astro";
import MonsterKbd from 'src/components/MonsterKbd.astro'

## Objectives

Now that we have updated the Prisma schema and pushed these changes to the database, we need to update the project structure to reflect these changes.

## Update permissions

The first thing we need to do is update the permissions in the `app/utils/user.ts` file.

:::note

### ðŸ’¡ Tip - quick file open

Remember that you can quickly find a file inside VS Code by using the keyboard shortcut:

- <MonsterKbd>CTRL + P</MonsterKbd> (Windows)
- <MonsterKbd>CMD + P</MonsterKbd> (Mac)

Type in the name of the file you want to open and select it from the list that appears.

:::

Permissions describe what actions a user can perform on a specific entity. In our case, we are concentrating on two entities: `user` and `article`.

<Steps>

1. Open the `app/utils/user.ts` file.

2. We will update the `Entity` type definition to accept `'article'` as well as `'user'` and `'note'`.

		Around line 28, add the code below:

		```diff lang="tsx" title="app/utils/user.ts" ins=" | 'article'" showLineNumbers collapse={1-25}
		import { type SerializeFrom } from '@remix-run/node'
		import { useRouteLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
		import { type loader as rootLoader } from '#app/root.tsx'

		function isUser(user: any): user is SerializeFrom<typeof rootLoader>['user'] {
			return user && typeof user === 'object' && typeof user.id === 'string'
		}

		export function useOptionalUser() {
			const data = useRouteLoaderData<typeof rootLoader>('root')
			if (!data || !isUser(data.user)) {
				return undefined
			}
			return data.user
		}

		export function useUser() {
			const maybeUser = useOptionalUser()
			if (!maybeUser) {
				throw new Error(
					'No user found in root loader, but user is required by useUser. If user is optional, try useOptionalUser instead.',
				)
			}
			return maybeUser
		}

		type Action = 'create' | 'read' | 'update' | 'delete'
		type Entity = 'user' | 'note' | 'article'
		type Access = 'own' | 'any' | 'own,any' | 'any,own'
		export type PermissionString =
			| `${Action}:${Entity}`
			| `${Action}:${Entity}:${Access}`

		// ...Code omitted for brevity...
		```

3. Remember to **save** your changes before moving on to the next step.

</Steps>

## Add `getArticleImgSrc` function

Inside the `utils` folder, there is a file called `misc.tsx`.

<Steps>

1. Open `app/utils/misc.tsx`.

2. Create a new function called `getArticleImgSrc` by adding the code below:

		This simply generates a URL for an article image:

		```diff title="app/utils/misc.tsx" lang="tsx"
		import { useFormAction, useNavigation } from '@remix-run/react'
		import { clsx, type ClassValue } from 'clsx'
		import { useEffect, useMemo, useRef, useState } from 'react'
		import { useSpinDelay } from 'spin-delay'
		import { extendTailwindMerge } from 'tailwind-merge'
		import { extendedTheme } from './extended-theme.ts'

		export function getUserImgSrc(imageId?: string | null) {
			return imageId ? `/resources/user-images/${imageId}` : '/img/user.png'
		}

		export function getNoteImgSrc(imageId: string) {
			return `/resources/note-images/${imageId}`
		}

		+export function getArticleImgSrc(imageId: string) {
		+	return `/resources/article-images/${imageId}`
		+}
		```

3. Save your changes.

</Steps>

This new function simply generates a URL to load an article image from the database. However, the file for this new URL doesn't exist yet.

Let's create it in the next step.

## Resources routes

The route file we are going to create is a little different from the others we have created so far. We are going to create something called a [**resource route**](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/resource-routes).

:::note

### What is a resource route?

In Remix, a [**resource route**](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/resource-routes) is one that doesn't render a page to their browser, but instead can send any kind of `Response` that we need it to.

We will create a new resource route to serve the images for the articles.

:::

### Create `article-images.$imageId.tsx`

<Steps>

1. Create a new file inside `app/routes/resources+/` called `article-images.$imageId.tsx`:

		![Create article-images file](src/assets/webp/epic-news/create-article-images-route.webp)

2. Add the code below to it:

		```diff title="app/routes/resources+/article-images.$imageId.tsx" lang="tsx" showLineNumbers
		+import { invariantResponse } from '@epic-web/invariant'
		+import { type LoaderFunctionArgs } from '@remix-run/node'
		+import { prisma } from '~/utils/db.server.ts'
		+
		+export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
		+	invariantResponse(params.imageId, 'Image ID is required', { status: 400 })
		+	const image = await prisma.articleImage.findUnique({
		+		where: { id: params.imageId },
		+		select: { contentType: true, blob: true },
		+	})
		+
		+	invariantResponse(image, 'Not found', { status: 404 })
		+
		+	return new Response(image.blob, {
		+		headers: {
		+			'Content-Type': image.contentType,
		+			'Content-Length': Buffer.byteLength(image.blob).toString(),
		+			'Content-Disposition': `inline; filename="${params.imageId}"`,
		+			'Cache-Control': 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable',
		+		},
		+	})
		+}
		```

		3. Save your changes.

		4. Take a moment to look through the code, and see if you can understand what it does.

				What do you notice is missing from this route file that is present in the others?

</Steps>

## Add user-article routes

Using VS Code's file explorer, navigate to the folder `app/routes/users+/$username_+`.

To manually update each of these files inside `$username_+` would take a disproportionately long time, so instead you can download an updated version of this folder here:

:::danger

These next steps can be particularly difficult, so please read them carefully and follow along closely.

:::

<a href="/code-monster/downloads/epic-news/$username_+.zip" class="group inline-flex border-2 gap-4 mt-8 px-8 py-4 text-xl rounded-full no-underline transition bg-blue-200 border-blue-400 hover:border-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-600 dark:border-blue-400 dark:hover:border-blue-300 dark:hover:bg-blue-700">
	<Icon name="seti:folder" class="fill-blue-600 transition group-hover:scale-125 group-hover:fill-blue-800 dark:fill-blue-100 dark:group-hover:fill-blue-50" /> <span class="text-blue-600 transition group-hover:text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-100 dark:group-hover:text-blue-50">$username_+.zip</span>
</a>

<Steps>

1. After clicking on the blue download button above, navigate to your browser's download button and click to 'Show in Folder'

		![Show in folder](src/assets/webp/epic-news/download-username-zip.webp)

2. Open the Downloads folder on your computer, right-click on the `$username_+.zip` file, and select 'Extract All...'.

		![Extract zip](src/assets/webp/epic-news/extract-zip.webp)

3. In the pop-up window that appears, click 'Browse'. Navigate to your 'Downloads' folder again, click 'Select Folder', and finally click 'Extract' to unzip the folder.

		Watch the gif below to make sure you extract the folder correctly:

		![Extract folder](src/assets/gif/extract-folder.gif)

4. Once you have extracted the folder, you are ready to replace the existing `app/routes/users+/$username_+` folder with the new one.

		Start by right-clicking the existing `$username_+` folder in your project (located at `app/routes/users+/$username_+`) and selecting 'Delete'.

		![Delete existing folder](src/assets/webp/epic-news/delete-$username_+.webp)

5. Finally, drag the new `$username_+` folder from your Downloads folder into the `app/routes/users+` folder in your project.

		Watch the gif below ***carefully*** to make sure you drag the new folder into the correct location:

		![Copy article files to project](src/assets/gif/copy-article-files-to-project.gif)

</Steps>

If placed correctly, your new folder structure should look like this:

![New folder structure](src/assets/webp/epic-news/new-folder-structure.webp)

## Summary

In this tutorial, we updated the project structure to reflect the changes we made to the Prisma schema.

- We updated the permissions in the `app/utils/permissions.ts` file to reflect the new entity name.
- We replaced the `note` files in the `app/routes/users+/$username_+` folder with the updated `article` files.

::::note[Assignment]

## ðŸ“„ Assignment documentation

We need to update your assignment to document this new feature. ðŸš€

1. Explain the purpose of the `app/utils/permissions.ts` file.
2. Describe the changes made to the `Entity` type definition in the `app/utils/permissions.ts` file.
3. Explain the purpose of the `app/routes/users+/$username_+` folder.

## What's next?

In the next tutorial, we will modify the seed data to include some article categories and dummy articles that will be used to populate the database.
