title: Modify seed data
description: Update the seed data to include some categories and dummy articles that will be used to populate the database.
---

import MonsterReveal from "src/components/MonsterReveal.astro";

## Objectives

Now that we have [**updated the Prisma schema**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/prisma/schema-updates) to include `Category` and `Article` models, we need to update the seed data to include some categories and dummy articles that will be used to populate the database.

This will involve:

1. Updating the `seed.ts` file to include some categories and articles.
2. Associating the articles with the categories.
3. Linking articles to the users.
4. Running the seed script to populate the database with the new data.

üöÄ **Let's get started!** üöÄ

## Update the seed data

Open the `prisma/seed.ts` file and look carefully at the code inside. There is a lot going on here!

Essentially, the seed script is using Prisma Client to create some dummy data for the database.

### Code annotation

#### Instructions

Can you work out what the `seed` function is doing? ü§î

1. Look for places where notes are being created and associated with other entities like users and images. These are the places where we will need to edit.

2. As you find these places, add a `TODO` comment to remind yourself to come back and update the code.

    This is a common practice in professional software development to help you remember to come back and finish something later.

    For example, on line 28 you will see the following code:

    ```ts showLineNumbers startLineNumber=28
    const entities = ['user', 'note']
    ```

    In this case, you would add a `TODO` comment by:

      - opening a comment with two forward slashes: `//`
      - writing the word `TODO` in all caps followed by a colon and a space
      - finally writing a brief description of what needs to be done

    So, a complete `TODO` comment in this instance would look like this:

    ```diff lang="ts"  showLineNumbers startLineNumber=28
    +// TODO: Swap 'note' for 'article'
    const entities = ['user', 'note']
    ```

3. Once you have found as many as you can, add a final `TODO` comment marking the place where you think it would be best to seed `articleCategories` to the database.

    **TIP** - This should be relatively early in the function, before we create any `articles`.

4. Reveal the section below to see where `TODO` comments could be added.

Anyway, I found myself at the other end of the field with the ball. It was just me and the goalie. I normally just kick the ball and hope it goes in, but the ball was already rolling toward the goal. The goalie was about to get the ball, so I had to charge. I managed to get possession of the ball just before the goalie got it. I brought it around the goalie and had a perfect shot. I screamed so loud in excitement. After all these years playing, I finally scored a goal!\n\nI know it's not a lot for most folks, but it meant a lot to me. We did end up winning the game by one. It makes me feel great that I had a part to play in that.\n\nIn this team, I'm the captain. I'm constantly cheering my team on. Even after getting injured, I continued to come and watch from the side-lines. I enjoy yelling (encouragingly) at my team mates and helping them be the best they can. I'm definitely not the best player by a long stretch. But I really enjoy the game. It's a great way to get exercise and have good social interactions once a week.\n\nThat said, it can be hard to keep people coming and paying dues and stuff. If people don't show up it can be really hard to find subs. I have a list of people I can text, but sometimes I can't find anyone.\n\nBut yeah, today was awesome. I felt like more than just a player that gets in the way of the opposition, but an actual asset to the team. Really great feeling.\n\nAnyway, I'm rambling at this point and really this is just so we can have a note that's pretty long to test things out. I think it's long enough now... Cheers!",

### Add article categories

Let's start by adding some article categories to the seed data.

We can do this with the `create` method on the `prisma.category` object.

Add the code below just after the `console.timeEnd('üëë Created roles...')` statement around line 59:

```diff lang="ts" title="prisma/seed.ts" showlineNumbers startLineNumber=14 collapse={2-45}
async function seed() {
	console.log('üå± Seeding...')
	console.time(`üå± Database has been seeded`)

	console.time('üßπ Cleaned up the database...')
	await cleanupDb(prisma)
	console.timeEnd('üßπ Cleaned up the database...')

	console.time('üîë Created permissions...')
	// TODO: Swap 'note' for 'article'
	const entities = ['user', 'note']
	const actions = ['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete']
	const accesses = ['own', 'any'] as const
	for (const entity of entities) {
		for (const action of actions) {
			for (const access of accesses) {
				await prisma.permission.create({ data: { entity, action, access } })
			}
		}
	}
	console.timeEnd('üîë Created permissions...')

	console.time('üëë Created roles...')
	await prisma.role.create({
		data: {
			name: 'admin',
			permissions: {
				connect: await prisma.permission.findMany({
					select: { id: true },
					where: { access: 'any' },
				}),
			},
		},
	})
	await prisma.role.create({
		data: {
			name: 'user',
			permissions: {
				connect: await prisma.permission.findMany({
					select: { id: true },
					where: { access: 'own' },
				}),
			},
		},
	})
	console.timeEnd('üëë Created roles...')

-	// TODO: create categories
+	const techCategory = await prisma.articleCategory.create({
+		data: { name: 'Technology', slug: 'technology' },
+	})
+	const entertainmentCategory = await prisma.articleCategory.create({
+		data: { name: 'Entertainment', slug: 'entertainment' },
+	})
+	const businessCategory = await prisma.articleCategory.create({
+		data: { name: 'Business', slug: 'business' },
+	})
+
  const totalUsers = 5
  console.time(`üë§ Created ${totalUsers} users...`

  // [... Code omitted for brevity ...]
}
```

In this code snippet, we are creating three categories: `Tech`, `Games`, and `Artificial Intelligence`.

:::note

You'll notice that we have captured all of the created categories as variables, e.g.

```ts title="prisma/seed.ts" ins="const techCategory = "
const techCategory = await prisma.articleCategory.create({
  data: { name: 'Technology', slug: 'technology' },
})
```

This is because we will need to reference these categories when associating articles with categories later.

:::

Let's move on to implement all the `article` related `TODO` comments.

## Updating articles

Now that we have created some article categories, we can create some articles and link them together.

:::tip[Challenge]

### ToDo Tree and managing `TODO` comments

If you installed the recommended plugins when you initially cloned your project, you should already have an extension called `ToDo Tree` installed in your editor.

If you have, you will see a little tree icon in the left gutter of your editor. (If not, you can install it from the extensions marketplace [**here**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree).)

Clicking on this icon will show you a list of all the `TODO` comments in your code that were added in the [**step above**](#code-annotation):

![ToDo Tree Extension](src/assets/png/epic-news/todo-tree-extension.png)

Working your way through this list, try to convert as many seed `notes` to `articles` as you can by yourself.

Once you have done as much as you can, reveal the section below to see the full updated `seed` function.

<MonsterReveal>

### `tests/db-utils.ts`

#### Update `getNoteImages` to `getArticleImages`

Firstly, lets update the `getNoteImages` function in `tests/db-utils.ts`, as this is used by the `seed` function to associate images correctly.

Luckily, there's not much to do here - it's just a case of renaming the main function and variable to make sense with our new `article` model:

```diff lang="ts" title="tests/db-utils.ts" showlineNumbers startLineNumber=41 ins="getArticleImages()" ins="articleImages" collapse={10-42}
let articleImages: Array<Awaited<ReturnType<typeof img>>> | undefined
export async function getArticleImages() {
	if (articleImages) return articleImages

	articleImages = await Promise.all([
		img({
			altText: 'a nice country house',
			filepath: './tests/fixtures/images/notes/0.png',
		}),
		img({
			altText: 'a city scape',
			filepath: './tests/fixtures/images/notes/1.png',
		}),
		img({
			altText: 'a sunrise',
			filepath: './tests/fixtures/images/notes/2.png',
		}),
		img({
			altText: 'a group of friends',
			filepath: './tests/fixtures/images/notes/3.png',
		}),
		img({
			altText: 'friends being inclusive of someone who looks lonely',
			filepath: './tests/fixtures/images/notes/4.png',
		}),
		img({
			altText: 'an illustration of a hot air balloon',
			filepath: './tests/fixtures/images/notes/5.png',
		}),
		img({
			altText:
				'an office full of laptops and other office equipment that look like it was abandoned in a rush out of the building in an emergency years ago.',
			filepath: './tests/fixtures/images/notes/6.png',
		}),
		img({
			altText: 'a rusty lock',
			filepath: './tests/fixtures/images/notes/7.png',
		}),
		img({
			altText: 'something very happy in nature',
			filepath: './tests/fixtures/images/notes/8.png',
		}),
		img({
			altText: `someone at the end of a cry session who's starting to feel a little better.`,
			filepath: './tests/fixtures/images/notes/9.png',
		}),
	])

	return articleImages
}
```

### `prisma/seed.ts`

Once the `getArticleImages` function has been updated, we can move on to updating the `seed` function in `prisma/seed.ts`.

Here is the full updated `seed` function with new code highlighted in green, and old comments highlighted in red.

If it helps, you can copy the entire code below and paste it into your `prisma/seed.ts` file to completely replace the existing code.

```diff lang="ts" title="prisma/seed.ts" showlineNumbers startLineNumber=1 ins="getArticleImages," ins="'article', 'articleCategory'" collapse={15-20, 27-73, 111-153, 243-289}

							"Just got back from the most amazing game. I've been playing soccer for a long time, but I've not once scored a goal. Well, today all that changed! I finally scored my first ever goal.\n\nI'm in an indoor league, and my team's not the best, but we're pretty good and I have fun, that's all that really matters. Anyway, I found myself at the other end of the field with the ball. It was just me and the goalie. I normally just kick the ball and hope it goes in, but the ball was already rolling toward the goal. The goalie was about to get the ball, so I had to charge. I managed to get possession of the ball just before the goalie got it. I brought it around the goalie and had a perfect shot. I screamed so loud in excitement. After all these years playing, I finally scored a goal!\n\nI know it's not a lot for most folks, but it meant a lot to me. We did end up winning the game by one. It makes me feel great that I had a part to play in that.\n\nIn this team, I'm the captain. I'm constantly cheering my team on. Even after getting injured, I continued to come and watch from the side-lines. I enjoy yelling (encouragingly) at my team mates and helping them be the best they can. I'm definitely not the best player by a long stretch. But I really enjoy the game. It's a great way to get exercise and have good social interactions once a week.\n\nThat said, it can be hard to keep people coming and paying dues and stuff. If people don't show up it can be really hard to find subs. I have a list of people I can text, but sometimes I can't find anyone.\n\nBut yeah, today was awesome. I felt like more than just a player that gets in the way of the opposition, but an actual asset to the team. Really great feeling.\n\nAnyway, I'm rambling at this point and really this is just so we can have a note that's pretty long to test things out. I think it's long enough now... Cheers!",

	console.timeEnd(`üê® Created admin user "kody"`)

	console.timeEnd(`üå± Database has been seeded`)
}

## Run the seed script

Now that we have updated the seed script, we can run it to populate the database with new dummy data.

To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```txt frame="terminal"
npm run setup
```

After a few moments, you should see the following output:

```txt frame="none"
üå±  The seed command has been executed.
```

Once you do, check the new database in Prisma Studio to see the new data.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```txt frame="terminal"
npx prisma studio
```

You should see your database has been populated with new data:

![Database with seed data](src/assets/png/epic-news/database-with-seed-data.png)

Feel free to click into the database and explore how the users, articles and categories are linked together.

:::

## Summary

In this step, we have:

- Updated the seed script to create article categories.
- Updated the seed script to create articles and link them to users, article images and categories.
- Run the seed script to populate the database with new data.
- Checked the database in Prisma Studio to see the new data.

In the next step, we will update the `articles` page to display the new articles.
