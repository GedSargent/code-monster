title: Modify seed data
description: Update the seed data to include some categories and dummy articles that will be used to populate the database.
---

import MonsterReveal from "src/components/MonsterReveal.astro";

## Objectives

Now that we have [**updated the Prisma schema**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/prisma/schema-updates) to include `Category` and `Article` models, we need to update the seed data to include some categories that will be used to populate the database.

This involves three steps:

1. Updating the `seed.ts` file to include some categories.
2. Ensuring 'articles' are included in the entities that users can create, read, update and delete.
2. Running the seed script to populate the database with the new data.

🚀 **Let's get started!** 🚀

## Update the seed data

Open the `prisma/seed.ts` file and look carefully at the code inside. There is a lot going on here!

Essentially, the seed script is using Prisma Client to create some dummy data for the database.

### Add article categories

Let's start by adding some article categories to the seed data.

We can do this with the `create` method on the `prisma.category` object.

Add the code below just after the `console.timeEnd('👑 Created roles...')` statement around line 61:

```diff lang="ts" title="prisma/seed.ts" showlineNumbers collapse={1-60, 76-277}

	createUser,
	getNoteImages,
	getUserImages,
	img,

import { insertGitHubUser } from '#tests/mocks/github.ts'

async function seed() {
	console.log('🌱 Seeding...')

In this code snippet, we are creating three categories: `Tech`, `Games`, and `Artificial Intelligence`.

### Add articles to permitted entities

Towards the top of the `seed` function is an array called `entities`, around line 23.

:::note

This array describes the entities that users are allowed to create, read, update, and delete.

Currently, it only contains the `User` and `Note` entities.

:::

Update this array to include the `Article` entity:

:::caution

Make sure that you have saved all these changes before continuing.

## Run the seed script

Now that we have updated the seed script, we can run it to populate the database with new dummy data.

To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```txt frame="terminal"
npm run setup
```

After a few moments, you should see something similar to the following output (the time taken may vary):

```txt frame="none" {7, 10}
Running seed command `tsx prisma/seed.ts` ...
🌱 Seeding...
prisma:query - 36ms - DELETE from "User"
🧹 Cleaned up the database...: 62.516ms
🔑 Created permissions...: 11.604ms
👑 Created roles...: 26.458ms
📝 Created article categories...: 27.36ms
👤 Created 5 users...: 1.489s
🐨 Created admin user "kody": 673.453ms
🌱 Database has been seeded: 2.292s

The seed command has been executed.
```
:::note

Notice the `article categories` that have been created in the output? This is the new seed data that we have added to the database.

:::

After seeing this message, we are ready to check the new database in Prisma Studio.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```txt frame="terminal"
npx prisma studio
```

You should see your database has been populated with new data:

![Database with seed data](src/assets/webp/epic-news/new-db-with-seed-data.webp)

Feel free to click into the database and explore how the categories appear in the new table.

## Summary

In this step, we have:

- Updated the seed script to create article categories.
- Updated the seed script to create articles and link them to users, article images and categories.
- Run the seed script to populate the database with new data.
- Checked the database in Prisma Studio to see the new data.

::::note[Assignment]

## 📄 Assignment documentation

We need to update your assignment to document this new feature. 🚀

1. Why do developers use seed scripts to populate the database with data? Why not do this manually?
2. Explain how you created the article categories in the seed script.
3. How did you run the seed script to populate the database with new data?

## What's next?

In the next step, we will update the `articles` page to display the new articles.
