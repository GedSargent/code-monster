## Objectives

Now that we have [**updated the Prisma schema**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/prisma/schema-updates) to include `Category` and `Article` models, we need to update the seed data to include some categories that will be used to populate the database.

This just involve three steps:

1. Updating the `seed.ts` file to include some categories.
2. Ensuring 'articles' are included in the entities that users can create, read, update and delete.
2. Running the seed script to populate the database with the new data.

🚀 **Let's get started!** 🚀

## Update the seed data

Open the `prisma/seed.ts` file and look carefully at the code inside. There is a lot going on here!

Essentially, the seed script is using Prisma Client to create some dummy data for the database.

### Add article categories

Let's start by adding some article categories to the seed data.

We can do this with the `create` method on the `prisma.category` object.

Add the code below just after the `console.timeEnd('👑 Created roles...')` statement around line 61:

```diff lang="ts" title="prisma/seed.ts" showlineNumbers startLineNumber=61 collapse={}
	console.timeEnd('👑 Created roles...')

+	console.time('📝 Created article categories...')
+	await prisma.articleCategory.create({
+		data: { name: 'Technology', slug: 'technology' },
+	})
+	await prisma.articleCategory.create({
+		data: { name: 'Entertainment', slug: 'entertainment' },
+	})
+	await prisma.articleCategory.create({
+		data: { name: 'Business', slug: 'business' },
+	})
+	console.timeEnd('📝 Created article categories...')

  const totalUsers = 5
  console.time(`👤 Created ${totalUsers} users...`

  // [... Code omitted for brevity ...]
```

In this code snippet, we are creating three categories: `Tech`, `Games`, and `Artificial Intelligence`.

### Add articles to permitted entities

Towards the top of the `seed` function is an array called `entities`, around line 23.

This array contains the entities that users can create, read, update, and delete. Currently, it only contains the `User` and `Note` entities:

```ts title="prisma/seed.ts" mark={10}
async function seed() {
	console.log('🌱 Seeding...')
	console.time(`🌱 Database has been seeded`)

	console.time('🧹 Cleaned up the database...')
	await cleanupDb(prisma)
	console.timeEnd('🧹 Cleaned up the database...')

	console.time('🔑 Created permissions...')
	const entities = ['user', 'note']
	const actions = ['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete']
	const accesses = ['own', 'any'] as const

  // ... Code omitted for brevity ...
}
```

Update this array to include the `Article` entity:

```diff title="prisma/seed.ts" lang="ts" showlineNumbers startLineNumber=23 ins=", 'article'"
  const entities = ['user', 'note', 'article']
```

## Run the seed script

Now that we have updated the seed script, we can run it to populate the database with new dummy data.

To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```txt frame="terminal"
npm run setup
```

After a few moments, you should see the following output:

```txt frame="none"
🌱  The seed command has been executed.
```

Once you do, check the new database in Prisma Studio to see the new data.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```txt frame="terminal"
npx prisma studio
```

You should see your database has been populated with new data:

![Database with seed data](src/assets/webp/epic-news/new-db-with-seed-data.webp)

Feel free to click into the database and explore how the categories appear in the new table.

## Summary

In this step, we have:

- Updated the seed script to create article categories.
- Updated the seed script to create articles and link them to users, article images and categories.
- Run the seed script to populate the database with new data.
- Checked the database in Prisma Studio to see the new data.

## 📄 Assignment documentation

We need to update your assignment to document this new feature. 🚀

1. Why do developers use seed scripts to populate the database with data? Why not do this manually?
2. Explain how you created the article categories in the seed script.
3. How did you run the seed script to populate the database with new data?
4. What did you see when you checked the database in Prisma Studio?

## What's next?

In the next step, we will update the `articles` page to display the new articles.
