## Objectives

In this section, we will begin the process of adding articles to the app, associating them with users and displaying some raw article data on the front-end. This will involve:

1. Updating the Prisma schema found at `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Updating the seed data generated in `prisma/seed.ts` to populate our database with some dummy articles
3. Changing the file structure of the project to add 'articles' as well as the 'articles' which already exist
4. Display some raw, unstyled article data in the `/news/$category.tsx` route file that we created in a [**previous lesson**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/routing/dynamic-routes#creating-a-dynamic-route)

üöÄ **Let's get started!** üöÄ

## The schema file

A Prisma schema is a file that serves as a blueprint for your database, defining the structure of your data.

Open the Prisma schema for the project which can be found at `prisma/schema.prisma`.

:::article

In a Prisma schema, you define your data models, each representing a table in the database. For each model, you specify the fields (which correspond to columns in the database table), their types, and any constraints or relations they might have.

:::

In the code snippet below is a copy of the `User`, `Article` and `ArticleImage` models from the project.

Click on the collapsed lines to expand them one at a time, and look carefully at the links between them.

Can you see how they are related to each other? üßê

```prisma showLineNumbers collapse={2-15, 19-34, 38-50}
model User {
  id       String  @id @default(cuid())
  email    String  @unique
  username String  @unique
  name     String?

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  image       UserImage?
  password    Password?
  articles    Article[]
  roles       Role[]
  sessions    Session[]
  connections Connection[]
}

model Article {
  id      String @id @default(cuid())
  title   String
  content String

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  owner   User   @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  ownerId String

  images ArticleImage[]

  // non-unique foreign key
  @@index([ownerId])
  // This helps our order by in the user search a LOT
  @@index([ownerId, updatedAt])
}

model ArticleImage {
  id          String  @id @default(cuid())
  altText     String?
  contentType String
  blob        Bytes

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  article   Article   @relation(fields: [articleId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  articleId String

  // non-unique foreign key
  @@index([articleId])
}
```

Let's take each of the models in turn:

<MonsterReveal title="The `User` Model">

### `User`

- A user has an `id`, `email`, `username` and `name` field. The `id`, `email` and `username` fields are required and unique. This means that they are all mandatory and must be unique for each user; no two users can share the same email address, for example.
- A user can also have an `image` and a `password`. Article that the `image` and `password` fields are optional. We can tell this because they are defined with a `?` at the end of the type declaration.
- A user can have many `articles`, `roles`, `sessions` and `connections`.

```prisma
model User {
  id       String  @id @default(cuid())
  email    String  @unique
  username String  @unique
  name     String?

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  image       UserImage?
  password    Password?
  articles       Article[]
  roles       Role[]
  sessions    Session[]
  connections Connection[]
}
```

</MonsterReveal>

<MonsterReveal title="The `Article` model">

### `Article`

- An article must have an `id`, `title` and `content` field. The `id` field is the primary key and is generated automatically using the `cuid()` function.
- An article can have many `images`.
- An article belongs to a `user` (the `owner` field). This is known as a **one-to-many relationship**, as a user can have many `articles`, but an `article` can only belong to one `user`.
- The `ownerId` field is a foreign key that references the `id` field of the `User` model.
- The `ownerId` field and the `updatedAt` field are indexed to improve performance. We can tell this because of the `@@index` directive at the end of the model.

```prisma
model Article {
  id      String @id @default(cuid())
  title   String
  content String

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  owner   User   @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  ownerId String

  images ArticleImage[]

  // non-unique foreign key
  @@index([ownerId])
  // This helps our order by in the user search a LOT
  @@index([ownerId, updatedAt])
}
```

</MonsterReveal>

<MonsterReveal title="The `ArticleImage` model">

### `ArticleImage`

- An `articleImage` belongs to an `article`. This is known as a **one-to-many relationship**, as an `article` can have many `images`, but an `image` can only belong to one `article`.
- The `articleId` field is a foreign key that references the `id` field of the `Article` model.
- The `articleId` field is indexed to improve performance. We can tell this because of the `@@index` directive at the end of the model.

```prisma
model ArticleImage {
  id          String  @id @default(cuid())
  altText     String?
  contentType String
  blob        Bytes

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  article   Article   @relation(fields: [articleId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  articleId String

  // non-unique foreign key
  @@index([articleId])
}
```

</MonsterReveal>

## Additional `Article` fields

We need to add some additional fields to the `Article` model to indicate whether an article is **published** or **draft**, and when it was published.

### 1. Add `isPublished` and `publishedAt` fields

Carefully add the lines highlighted in green below to the `Article` model:

```diff lang="prisma" title="prisma/schema.prisma" collapse={11-19}
model Article {
  id          String @id @default(cuid())
  title       String
  content     String
+  isPublished Boolean @default(false)

+  publishedAt DateTime?
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  owner       User   @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  ownerId     String

  images      ArticleImage[]

  // non-unique foreign key
  @@index([ownerId])
  // This helps our order by in the user search a LOT
  @@index([ownerId, updatedAt])
}
```

#### Default values and optional fields

Notice that the `isPublished` field is a `Boolean` type with a default value of `false`. Similarly, the `publishedAt` field is a `DateTime` type that is optional.

Why do you think the `publishedAt` field is optional, and `isPublished` has an initial value of `false`? ü§î

<MonsterReveal>
- The `isPublished` field is a `Boolean` type because it can only have two values: `true` or `false`.

  It has a default value of `false` because an article is usually a draft when it is first created. When the article is published, the `isPublished` field will be set to `true`.
- The `publishedAt` field is optional because an article might be a draft and not yet published. In this case, the `publishedAt` field would be `null`.
</MonsterReveal>

### 2. Add an `ArticleCategory` model

Finally, we want to arrange the news articles into categories, such as 'Technology', 'Entertainment' and 'Business'.

To do this, we will create an `ArticleCategory` model and link it to the `Article` model.

<Steps>

1. Create an `ArticleCategory` model in the Prisma schema.

    This can be placed directly below the `ArticleImage` model in the Prisma schema.

    ```diff lang="prisma" title="prisma/schema.prisma" showLineNumbers startLineNumber={87} collapse={2-14}
    model ArticleImage {
      id          String  @id @default(cuid())
      altText     String?
      contentType String
      blob        Bytes

      createdAt DateTime @default(now())
      updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

      article     Article   @relation(fields: [articleId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
      articleId   String

      // non-unique foreign key
      @@index([articleId])
    }

    +model ArticleCategory {
    +  id          String @id @default(cuid())
    +  name        String
    +  slug        String @unique
    +  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
    +  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
    +
    +  articles    Article[]
    +}
    ```

2. Link the `Article` model to the new `ArticleCategory` model with the code below:

    ```diff lang="prisma" title="prisma/schema.prisma" showLineNumbers startLineNumber={66}
    model Article {
      id          String @id @default(cuid())
      title       String
      content     String
      isPublished Boolean @default(false)

      publishedAt DateTime?
      createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
      updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

      owner       User   @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
      ownerId     String

    +  category    ArticleCategory? @relation(fields: [categoryId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
    +  categoryId  String?

      images      ArticleImage[]

      // non-unique foreign key
      @@index([ownerId])
    +  @@index([categoryId])
      // This helps our order by in the user search a LOT
      @@index([ownerId, updatedAt])
    }
    ```
3. Remember to ***save*** your changes to the Prisma schema file.

</Steps>

## Migrate changes to database

Now that we've made all the necessary changes to the Prisma schema, we need to apply these changes to the database.

To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name "add-article-models"
```

Once the process has finished, you should see a a new migration file has appeared inside your `prisma/migrations` folder:

![Article migration file](src/assets/webp/epic-news/article-migration.webp)

### Check database changes

Let's check the database to confirm the changes have been applied. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

This will open the Prisma Studio interface in your browser. You should see the `Article`, `ArticleImage` and `ArticleCategory` models at the top of your models list:

![Check article migration](src/assets/png/epic-news/check-article-migration.png)

Currently, these tables will be empty, as we haven't added any seed data yet. We'll do that in the next section.

## Summary

In this section, we have:

- Updated the Prisma schema to include an `Article` model and an `ArticleImage` model.
- Updated the `User` model to include an `articles` field that references the `Article` model.
- Updated the `Article` model to include an `isPublished`, `publishedAt` and `category` field.
- Updated the `ArticleImage` model to reference the `Article` model instead of the `Article` model.
- Migrated these changes to the database.

## üìÑ Assignment documentation

We need to update your assignment to document this new feature. üöÄ

1. Explain how you updated the `Article` model to include an `isPublished`, `publishedAt` and `category` field.
2. Explain how you migrated these changes to the database.

## What's next?

In the next tutorial, we will make some adjustments to the project structure to reflect the changes we've made to the Prisma schema.
