import MonsterReveal from "src/components/MonsterReveal.astro";

## Objectives

In this section, we will begin the process of adding articles to the app, associating them with users and displaying some raw article data on the front-end. This will involve:

1. Updating the Prisma schema found at `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Updating the seed data generated in `prisma/seed.ts` to populate our database with some dummy articles
3. Changing the file structure of the project to add 'articles' as well as the 'notes' which already exist
4. Display some raw, unstyled article data in the `/news/$category.tsx` route file that we created in a [**previous lesson**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/routing/dynamic-routes#creating-a-dynamic-route)

üöÄ **Let's get started!** üöÄ

## The schema file

A Prisma schema is a file that serves as a blueprint for your database, defining the structure of your data.

Open the Prisma schema for the project which can be found at `prisma/schema.prisma`.

:::note

In a Prisma schema, you define your data models, each representing a table in the database. For each model, you specify the fields (which correspond to columns in the database table), their types, and any constraints or relations they might have.

:::

In the code snippet below is a copy of the `User`, `Note` and `NoteImage` models from the project.

Click on the collapsed lines to expand them one at a time, and look carefully at the links between them.

Can you see how they are related to each other? üßê

```prisma showLineNumbers collapse={2-15, 19-34, 38-50}
model User {
  id       String  @id @default(cuid())
  email    String  @unique
  username String  @unique
  name     String?

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  image       UserImage?
  password    Password?
  notes       Note[]
  roles       Role[]
  sessions    Session[]
  connections Connection[]
}

model Note {
  id      String @id @default(cuid())
  title   String
  content String

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  owner   User   @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  ownerId String

  images NoteImage[]

  // non-unique foreign key
  @@index([ownerId])
  // This helps our order by in the user search a LOT
  @@index([ownerId, updatedAt])
}

model NoteImage {
  id          String  @id @default(cuid())
  altText     String?
  contentType String
  blob        Bytes

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  note   Note   @relation(fields: [noteId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  noteId String

  // non-unique foreign key
  @@index([noteId])
}
```

Let's take each of the models in turn:

<MonsterReveal title="The `User` Model">

### `User`

- A user has an `id`, `email`, `username` and `name` field. The `id`, `email` and `username` fields are required and unique. This means that they are all mandatory and must be unique for each user; no two users can share the same email address, for example.
- A user can also have an `image` and a `password`. Note that the `image` and `password` fields are optional. We can tell this because they are defined with a `?` at the end of the type declaration.
- A user can have many `notes`, `roles`, `sessions` and `connections`.

```prisma
model User {
  id       String  @id @default(cuid())
  email    String  @unique
  username String  @unique
  name     String?

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  image       UserImage?
  password    Password?
  notes       Note[]
  roles       Role[]
  sessions    Session[]
  connections Connection[]
}
```

</MonsterReveal>

<MonsterReveal title="The `Note` model">

### `Note`

- A note must have an `id`, `title` and `content` field. The `id` field is the primary key and is generated automatically using the `cuid()` function.
- A note can have many `images`.
- A note belongs to a `user` (the `owner` field). This is known as a **one-to-many relationship**, as a user can have many `notes`, but a `note` can only belong to one `user`.
- The `ownerId` field is a foreign key that references the `id` field of the `User` model.
- The `ownerId` field and the `updatedAt` field are indexed to improve performance. We can tell this because of the `@@index` directive at the end of the model.

```prisma
model Note {
  id      String @id @default(cuid())
  title   String
  content String

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  owner   User   @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  ownerId String

  images NoteImage[]

  // non-unique foreign key
  @@index([ownerId])
  // This helps our order by in the user search a LOT
  @@index([ownerId, updatedAt])
}
```

</MonsterReveal>

<MonsterReveal title="The `NoteImage` model">

### `NoteImage`

- A `noteImage` belongs to a `note`. This is known as a **one-to-many relationship**, as a `note` can have many `images`, but an `image` can only belong to one `note`.
- The `noteId` field is a foreign key that references the `id` field of the `Note` model.
- The `noteId` field is indexed to improve performance. We can tell this because of the `@@index` directive at the end of the model.

```prisma
model NoteImage {
  id          String  @id @default(cuid())
  altText     String?
  contentType String
  blob        Bytes

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  note   Note   @relation(fields: [noteId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  noteId String

  // non-unique foreign key
  @@index([noteId])
}
```

</MonsterReveal>

## What does an `Article` model need?

Understanding what a `Note` model looks like is a good starting point for creating an `Article` model.

Think carefully about what an `Article` model will need in order to be useful for our app. ü§î

To get you started, an `Article` model should have:

- a `title` and `content` field.
- an `owner` field that references a `User`.
- an `images` field that references an `ArticleImage`. The `ArticleImage` should be a separate model. But what should it contain?

:::tip[Challenge]

1. Can you think of any other fields that an `Article` model might need? For example:
    - how could you indicate that an `Article` is published or draft?
    - how could you organise articles into categories such as 'news', 'reviews', 'tutorials' etc.?
    - should should everything related to an `Article` be contained within the `Article` model, or should some fields require a separate model?
    - If there are some fields that require separate models, what should these separate models contain? How would you link them to the `Article` model?

2. Using the `Note` model as a reference, sketch out an `Article` model in a FigJam diagram that meets the requirements above.
  - For each field, include the:
    - field name
    - data type (e.g. `String`, `DateTime`, `Boolean` etc.)
    - whether it is **required** or **optional**
    - if the field should have a **default value** and what that value should be
    - any **constraints** or **relationships** that the field should have
  - Don't worry about writing the actual code for this now, just focus on the fields and relationships that you think an `Article` model should have.

<MonsterReveal>

### Requirements for an `Article` model

An `Article` model should have the following:
- a `title` and `content` field. These fields should be of data type `String` and be required.
- an `owner` field that references a `User`.
- an `images` field that references an `ArticleImage`. The `ArticleImage` should be a separate model.
- an `isPublished` field that indicates whether the article is published or draft. This field should be of data type `Boolean` and have a default value of `false`.
- a `publishedAt` field that indicates when the article was published. This field should be of data type `DateTime` and be optional.
- an `ArticleCategory` model that organises articles into categories such as 'news', 'reviews', 'tutorials' etc. Each article should belong to a single category.

</MonsterReveal>

:::

## Creating an `Article` model

As you've probably realised by now, we are very lucky. Many of the features that we need for articles are already present in the `Note` model.

For example, the `title`, `content`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt` and `owner` fields are already present in the `Note` model.

Similarly, the `images` field is already present in the `Note` model, and the `NoteImage` model can be easily used as a template from which to create an `ArticleImage` model from.

### 1. Add an `Article` and `ArticleImage` model

Let's start by simply copying the `Note` and `NoteImage` models, and pasting these as `Article` and `ArticleImage` respectively. You for convenience, you can place these models directly below the `NoteImage` model in the Prisma schema.

:::caution[Ignore red lines]

When you paste the `Article` and `ArticleImage` models into the Prisma schema, you will see some red underlines appear.

Don't worry about these for now. We will fix these in the next step.

:::

```diff lang="prisma" title="prisma/schema.prisma" collapse={2-14}
model NoteImage {
  id          String  @id @default(cuid())
  altText     String?
  contentType String
  blob        Bytes

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  note   Note   @relation(fields: [noteId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  noteId String

  // non-unique foreign key
  @@index([noteId])
}

+model Article {
+  id      String @id @default(cuid())
+  title   String
+  content String
+
+  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
+  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
+
+  owner   User   @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
+  ownerId String
+
+  images NoteImage[]
+
+  // non-unique foreign key
+  @@index([ownerId])
+  // This helps our order by in the user search a LOT
+  @@index([ownerId, updatedAt])
+}
+
+model ArticleImage {
+  id          String  @id @default(cuid())
+  altText     String?
+  contentType String
+  blob        Bytes
+
+  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
+  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
+
+  note   Note   @relation(fields: [noteId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
+  noteId String
+
+  // non-unique foreign key
+  @@index([noteId])
+}
```

You'll notice several red underlines have appeared in the schema.

This is because we need to update the references in the `User`, `Article` and `ArticleImage` models.

We'll do this now.

### 2. Update `User` and `Article`

Let's start with just the `User` and `Article` models.

Add a relationship in the `User` model to the `Article` model like so:

```diff lang="prisma" title="prisma/schema.prisma" collapse={2-8, 20-27, 34-36}
model User {
  id       String  @id @default(cuid())
  email    String  @unique
  username String  @unique
  name     String?

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  image       UserImage?
  password    Password?
  notes       Note[]
+  articles    Article[]
  roles       Role[]
  sessions    Session[]
  connections Connection[]
}
```

Next, update the `Article` model to reference the `ArticleImage` model instead of the `NoteImage` model.

```diff lang="prisma" title="prisma/schema.prisma" collapse={2-6}
model Article {
  id      String @id @default(cuid())
  title   String
  content String

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  owner   User   @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  ownerId String

-  images NoteImage[]
+  images ArticleImage[]

  // non-unique foreign key
  @@index([ownerId])
  // This helps our order by in the user search a LOT
  @@index([ownerId, updatedAt])
}
```

Don't worry that `images ArticleImage[]` is still underlined red - there's one last change to make.

### 3. Update the `ArticleImage` model

The `ArticleImage` model is a little more complex, as it references the `Article` model as the parent.

In other words, each `ArticleImage` belongs to a single `Article` that it needs to reference via a foreign key.

We therefore need to make several changes here:

- rename the `note` field to `article`
- reference the `Article` model instead of the `Note` model
- rename the `noteId` field to `articleId`
- reference the `id` field of the `Article` model instead of the `Note` model
- update the `@@index` directive to reference `articleId` instead of `noteId`

:::danger[Extra care needed!]

This is a complex change, so take your time to place the code snippets exactly where shown in the diff below.

Remember, green lines are additions, and red lines are deletions.

:::

```diff lang="prisma" title="prisma/schema.prisma"
model ArticleImage {
  id          String    @id @default(cuid())
  altText     String?
  contentType String
  blob        Bytes

  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime  @updatedAt

-  note        Note      @relation(fields: [noteId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
+  article     Article   @relation(fields: [articleId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
-  noteId      String
+  articleId   String

  // non-unique foreign key
-  @@index([noteId])
+  @@index([articleId])
}
```

### 4. Additional `Article` fields

Finally, we need to add some additional fields to the `Article` model to indicate whether an article is published or draft, and when it was published:

```diff lang="prisma" title="prisma/schema.prisma" collapse={11-19}
model Article {
  id          String @id @default(cuid())
  title       String
  content     String
+  isPublished Boolean @default(false)

+  publishedAt DateTime?
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  owner       User   @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  ownerId     String

  images      ArticleImage[]

  // non-unique foreign key
  @@index([ownerId])
  // This helps our order by in the user search a LOT
  @@index([ownerId, updatedAt])
}
```

Notice that the `isPublished` field is a `Boolean` type with a default value of `false`. Similarly, the `publishedAt` field is a `DateTime` type that is optional.

Why do you think the `publishedAt` field is optional, and `isPublished` has an initial value of `false`? ü§î

<MonsterReveal>
- The `isPublished` field is a `Boolean` type because it can only have two values: `true` or `false`.

  It has a default value of `false` because an article is usually a draft when it is first created. When the article is published, the `isPublished` field will be set to `true`.
- The `publishedAt` field is optional because an article might be a draft and not yet published. In this case, the `publishedAt` field would be `null`.
</MonsterReveal>

:::tip[Challenge]

## Add a `Category` model and link to an `Article`

It's always a good idea to organise articles into categories such as 'Tech', 'Business', 'Gaming' etc.

See if you can do the next steps by yourself. If you get stuck, you can always check the solution below.

1. Create an `ArticleCategory` model in the Prisma schema.
2. The `ArticleCategory` model should have the following fields:
    - an `id` field of type `String` that is the primary key, and has a default value of `cuid()`
    - a `name` field of type `String`
    - a `slug` field of type `String` that is unique
    - a `createdAt` field of type `DateTime` that has a default value of `now()`
    - an `updatedAt` field of type `DateTime` that is updated automatically

3. Each article should belong to a single category. Add a `category` field to the `Article` model that references the `ArticleCategory` model.
4. The `category` field should be optional, as an article might not belong to any category.
5. Update the `Article` model to include a `categoryId` field that references the `id` field of the `ArticleCategory` model.
6. The `category` field should be set to cascade on delete and update.
7. The `categoryId` field should be indexed to improve performance.

#### ü¶â TIP

- Look back at the `Note` model to see how the `owner` field is linked to the `User` model. You will need to do something similar for the `category` field in the `Article` model.

### Solution

After you've had a go at the challenge, click the section below to reveal the solution.

<MonsterReveal>
1. Create an `ArticleCategory` model in the Prisma schema.

    This can be placed directly below the `ArticleImage` model in the Prisma schema.

```prisma title="prisma/schema.prisma"
model ArticleCategory {
  id          String @id @default(cuid())
  name        String
  slug        String @unique
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  articles    Article[]
}
```

2. Link the `Article` model to the new `ArticleCategory` model.
```diff lang="prisma" title="prisma/schema.prisma"
model Article {
  id          String @id @default(cuid())
  title       String
  content     String
  isPublished Boolean @default(false)

  publishedAt DateTime?
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  owner       User   @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
  ownerId     String

+  category    ArticleCategory? @relation(fields: [categoryId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade, onUpdate: Cascade)
+  categoryId  String?

  images      ArticleImage[]

  // non-unique foreign key
  @@index([ownerId])
+  @@index([categoryId])
  // This helps our order by in the user search a LOT
  @@index([ownerId, updatedAt])
}
```
</MonsterReveal>

:::

## Migrate changes to database

Now that we've made all the necessary changes to the Prisma schema, we need to apply these changes to the database.

To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name "add-article-models"
```

Once the process has finished, you should see a a new migration file has appeared inside your `prisma/migrations` folder:

![Article migration file](src/assets/webp/epic-news/article-migration.webp)

### Check database changes

Let's check the database to confirm the changes have been applied. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

This will open the Prisma Studio interface in your browser. You should see the `Article`, `ArticleImage` and `ArticleCategory` models at the top of your models list:

![Check article migration](src/assets/png/epic-news/check-article-migration.png)

Currently, these tables will be empty, as we haven't added any seed data yet. We'll do that in the next section.

## Summary

In this section, we have:

- Updated the Prisma schema to include an `Article` model and an `ArticleImage` model.
- Updated the `User` model to include an `articles` field that references the `Article` model.
- Updated the `Article` model to include an `isPublished`, `publishedAt` and `category` field.
- Updated the `ArticleImage` model to reference the `Article` model instead of the `Note` model.
- Migrated these changes to the database.
