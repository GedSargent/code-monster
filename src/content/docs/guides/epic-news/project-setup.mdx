discription: "Make sure your project is set up correctly before starting the Epic News project."

As always with Node project, we need to make sure our project is set up correctly before we start building our application.

The instructions below are all found in the project [**README File**](https://github.com/BSc-Web-Apps/epic-news-2-8-1?tab=readme-ov-file#-epic-news-), but these are reproduced here for your convenience.

## Getting started

1. Duplicate the file `.env.example`, and rename your duplicate to `.env`
2. Open a new terminal from the VS Code menu - `Terminal > New Terminal`
3. In your new terminal, type the following and hit return:

```sh
npm i
```

This process will take a while, so be patient 😴⏰

4. Once you see the message that everything has been installed, type the following into the terminal and hit return:

```sh
npm run setup
```

Again, this will take a while, so be patient 😴⏰

5. Finally, from the terminal again, type:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and you can view your project in a web browser by going to `http://localhost:3000`.

You should see a landing page that looks like this:

## What's next?

Now that you have your project set up, you're ready to start building the Epic News project. Let's get started!
