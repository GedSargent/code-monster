title: Dynamic routes and loader functions in Remix
description: Learn how to use route params to create dynamic routes in Remix, and access their values using loader functions.
---

import MonsterVideo from "src/components/MonsterVideo.astro"

With the changes we have made in the previous lesson, we have a news category page set up, but the content is always the same:

![Single dynamic route](src/assets/gif/single-dynamic-route.gif)

When we click each link, the URL changes in the browser's address bar, but the content in the window remains the same.

Why?

## Route params

The `$` sign in the file name `news/$category.tsx` is actually a special character that tells Remix that this route is ***dynamic***.

It means that the route can match any base URL that starts with `/news/`, but then will have a unique value for `category`.

So, for example, if we visited the URL:

```bash mark="business"
http://localhost:3000/news/business
```

...the `$category` value would be the string "`business`".

However, if we visited

```bash mark="reviews"
http://localhost:3000/news/reviews
```

...the `$category` value would then be the string "`reviews`", and so on.

## Reading route params with the `loader` function

To read the `category` value from the URL, we need to add something called a `loader` function to our `news/$category.tsx` file.

::::note[Info]

## What is a `loader` function?

Code placed inside a Remix `loader` function is executed on the **server**.

There are two rules to remember when creating a `loader` function:

1. The `loader` function needs to be placed inside a **route** file (i.e. a `tsx` file inside the `routes` folder)

2. It should prefixed with the `export` keyword so that Remix can access it.

		```tsx mark="export "
		export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
			// Server-side code here...
		}
		```

You can learn more about `loader` functions below:

More info is available in the [**Remix docs**](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/loader).

::::

At first, let's just log the `category` value out to the console and see what it looks like.

Carefully add the following code to your `news/$category.tsx` file:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.$category.tsx"
+import { type LoaderFunctionArgs, json } from '@remix-run/node'
+
+export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
+	const { category } = params
+
+	console.log({ category })
+
+	return json({})
+}

export default function NewsCategoryPage() {
	return (
		<div className="container py-16">
			<h2 className="text-h2">Generic news category page</h2>
		</div>
	)
}
```

:::caution[Important]

You'll notice the `loader` function is being passed a `params` object as an argument here:

```tsx "{ params }"
export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  // ... more code here...
}
```

This `params` object contains all the route parameters for the current route.

In our case, we are destructuring the `category` value from the `params` object like this:

```tsx "{ category }"
const { category } = params
```
:::

Head back to your browser and click the links between the different news categories.

Now check your VS Code terminal. You should see the `category` value logged out each time you click a link:

![Logging route params](src/assets/png/logging-route-params.png)

This is great!

We are loading the dynamic `category` value directly from the URL and logging it to the console.

In the next step, we will do something more useful with this value. We will pass it to our `NewsCategoryPage` component and display it on the page.

## Summary

In this step, we have:

- Deleted our hard-coded static child routes and replaced them with a single dynamic route.
- Learned about route params and how they can be used to create dynamic routes in Remix.
- Added a `loader` function to our dynamic route to read the `category` value from the URL.
- Logged the `category` value to the console to see what it looks like.

## What's next?

In the next step, we will pass the `category` value to our `NewsCategoryPage` component with Remix's `useLoaderData` hook, and display it on the page.
