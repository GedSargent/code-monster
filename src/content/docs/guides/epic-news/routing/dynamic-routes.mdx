title: Dynamic routing in Remix
description: Learn how to use route params to create dynamic routes in Remix.
---

In our previous lesson on [nested routes](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/routing/nested-routes), we created "News" route that enabled users to switch between different news categories.

We did this by creating a new route for each category, like this:

![News routes](src/assets/png/static-news-routes.png)

Creating static files for each child route is fine, but not very sustainable. What if we want to add a new category? We'd have to create a new file for it, and then update the code inside each child file so they are consistent.

In this lesson, we'll learn how to use route params to create dynamic routes in Remix. This will allow us to create a single route for all news categories, and then use the route params to fetch the correct data.

## Creating a dynamic route

Delete all your hard-coded static child routes. So in the example above, I would be deleting `news.business.tsx`, `news.entertainment.tsx`, `news.reviews.tsx` and `news.technology.tsx`

![Delete static routes](src/assets/png/delete-static-routes.png)

Create a new file in the `app/routes` directory called `news/$category.tsx`:

```tsx
export default function NewsCategoryPage() {
	return (
		<div className="container py-16">
			<h2 className="text-h2">Generic news category page</h2>
		</div>
	)
}
```

Now, head back to your browser. Try clicking the links to your different pages again. You will notice something strange has happened:

![Single dynamic route](src/assets/gif/single-dynamic-route.gif)

When we click each link, the URL route changes, but the content remains the same. Why?

## Route params

The `$` sign in the file name `news/$category.tsx` is a special character that tells Remix that this route is dynamic. It means that the route can match any URL that starts with `/news/` and then has a value for `category`.

At the moment, we are not doing anything with the `category` value. We need to update our `news/$category.tsx` file to read the `category` value from the URL and use it to display the correct data.

:::note[Route Params]

### What are "route params"?

Route params (or "parameters") are a way to pass data to a route.

In Remix, when we add a `$` to a route filename, anything after the `$` is considered a route param. For example, in the filename `news.$category.tsx`, `$category` becomes the route param that Remix will look for when a user visits the corresponding URL.

So, for example, consider the URL below:

```bash ins="business"
http://localhost:3000/news/business

```

Because we have named the file handling this route `news/$category.tsx`, Remix will pass the string value `business` into the file as a variable called `category`. If the route was `http://localhost:3000/news/reviews`, the value of `category` would be `reviews`, and so on

The name of this variable can be anything we choose, but it makes sense to name it after the route param it represents.

:::

In our case, the reason why we see the same content for each category is because we are not reading the `category` value from the URL. Let's fix that.

## Reading route params

To read the `category` value from the URL, we need to add a `loader` function to our `news/$category.tsx` file. This function will be called by Remix when the route is visited, and it will receive the route `params` as an argument:

At first, we will just log this value out to the console and see what it looks like:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.$category.tsx"
+import { type LoaderFunctionArgs, json } from '@remix-run/node'
+
+export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
+	const { category } = params
+
+	console.log({ category })
+
+	return json({})
+}

export default function NewsCategoryPage() {
	return (
		<div className="container py-16">
			<h2 className="text-h2">Generic news category page</h2>
		</div>
	)
}
```

Head back to your browser and click the links between the different news categories.

Now check your VS Code terminal. You should see the `category` value logged out each time you click a link:

![Logging route params](src/assets/png/logging-route-params.png)

## Passing data to the page

We are successfully reading the `category` value from the URL. Now we can use this value to fetch the correct data.

Let's update the `loader` function so it returns this value in title-case as part of the `json` response.

:::caution

After updating the code below, you'll see a red line under `category` because TypeScript doesn't know what data type it is yet.

Don't worry - we can fix this issue later.

For now, let's just return the `categoryTitle` value as part of the `json` response.
:::

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.$category.tsx" ins="{ categoryTitle }"
import { json, type LoaderFunctionArgs } from '@remix-run/node'
+import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'

+function toTitleCase(str: string) {
+	return str
+		.toLowerCase()
+		.split('-')
+		.map(function (word) {
+			return word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1)
+		})
+		.join(' ')
+}
+
export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
	const { category } = params

-	console.log({ category })
+	const categoryTitle = toTitleCase(category)

-	return json({})
+	return json({ categoryTitle })
}

export default function NewsCategoryPage() {
+	const { categoryTitle } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

	return (
		<div className="container py-16">
-			<h2 className="text-h2">Generic news category page</h2>
+			<h2 className="text-h2">{categoryTitle}</h2>
		</div>
	)
}
```

:::note

#### Code review

- We've added a new function called `toTitleCase` that takes a string and returns it in title-case format (in other words, with every first letter of a word capitalized).
```tsx
function toTitleCase(str: string) {
	return str
		.toLowerCase()
		.split('-')
		.map(function (word) {
			return word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1)
		})
		.join(' ')
}
```
---
- We call this function inside the `loader` function to convert the `category` value to title-case.
- We return the `categoryTitle` value as part of the `json` response.
```tsx
export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
	const { category } = params

	const categoryTitle = toTitleCase(category)

	return json({ categoryTitle })
}
```
---
- We call Remix's `useLoaderData` hook to read the `categoryTitle` value from the `loader` function.
```tsx
	const { categoryTitle } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
```
---
- We update the `h2` tag to display the `categoryTitle` value.
```tsx
		<h2 className="text-h2">{categoryTitle}</h2>
```

:::

## Checking the result

Now, head back to your browser and click the links between the different news categories again.

This time, you should see the title of the category displayed in every page, but we didn't need to hard-code a separate file for every one ðŸŽ‰:

![Custom title on every dynamic route](src/assets/gif/news-page-with-nav-links.gif)

## Fixing TypeScript errors

Finally, let's fix that TypeScript error we saw earlier.

We will do this using a package called [Invariant](https://github.com/zertosh/invariant). This package will help us to tell TypeScript that the `categoryTitle` value will always be a string.

First, import the package at the top of your `news.$category.tsx` file:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.$category.tsx"
+import { invariant } from '@epic-web/invariant'
import { json, type LoaderFunctionArgs } from '@remix-run/node'
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
```

Next, inside your `loader` function, add the following check:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.$category.tsx"
export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
	const { category } = params

+	invariant(typeof category === 'string', 'Category not found')
	const categoryTitle = toTitleCase(category)

	return json({ categoryTitle })
}
```

The red line has disappeared, and TypeScript now knows that `categoryTitle` will always be a string.

:::tip[Challenge]
1. Try adding three-five new categories to your `news` route. You don't need to create a new file for it - just add a new link to your `app/routes/index.tsx` file.
2. Update the layout of the `NewsCategoryPage` page by adding some dummy news story summary areas. You should see your changes reflected on every category page.

## Summary

In this lesson, we learned how to use route params to create dynamic routes in Remix.

- We created a single route for all news categories, and then used the route params to fetch the correct data.
- We also learned how to read route params using the `loader` function, and how to pass data to the page using the `json` response.
- We then read this data using the `useLoaderData` hook, and displayed it on the page.
- We fixed a TypeScript error by using the `invariant` package to tell TypeScript that the `categoryTitle` value will always be a string.
