title: Dynamic routes and loader functions in Remix
description: Learn how to use route params to create dynamic routes in Remix, and access their values using loader functions.
---

In our previous lesson on [**nested routes**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/routing/nested-routes), we created "News" route that enabled users to switch between different news categories.

We did this by creating a new route for each category, like this:

![News routes](src/assets/png/static-news-routes.png)

Creating static files for each child route is fine, but not very sustainable. What if we want to add a new category? We'd have to create a new file for it, and then update the code inside each child file so they are consistent.

In this lesson, we'll learn how to use route params to create dynamic routes in Remix. This will allow us to create a single route for all news categories, and then use the route params to fetch the correct data.

## Creating a dynamic route

Delete all your hard-coded static child routes. So in the example above, I would be deleting `news.business.tsx`, `news.entertainment.tsx`, `news.reviews.tsx` and `news.technology.tsx`, and replace them all with a single file called `news.$category.tsx`.

![Delete static routes](src/assets/png/delete-static-routes.png)

Inside your new `news/$category.tsx` file, add the following code:

```tsx
export default function NewsCategoryPage() {
	return (
		<div className="container py-16">
			<h2 className="text-h2">Generic news category page</h2>
		</div>
	)
}
```

Now, head back to your browser and refresh your page. Try clicking the links to your different pages again. You will notice something strange has happened:

![Single dynamic route](src/assets/gif/single-dynamic-route.gif)

When we click each link, the URL changes in the browser's address bar, but the content in the window remains the same.

Why?

## Route params

The `$` sign in the file name `news/$category.tsx` is actually a special character that tells Remix that this route is **dynamic**. It means that the route can match any base URL that starts with `/news/`, but then has a unique value for `category`.

So, for example, if we visited the URL:

```bash mark="business"
http://localhost:3000/news/business
```

...the `category` value would be the string "`business`".

However, if we visited

```bash mark="reviews"
http://localhost:3000/news/reviews
```

...the `category` value would then be the string "`reviews`", and so on.

:::note[Deep Dive]

### Why use route params?

Route params provide an easy way to pass values to a route.

They are essentially variables that can represent different value for each URL that matches a particular base route.

In Remix, when we add a `$` to a route filename, anything before the `$` can be thought of as the base route, and anything immediately after it is considered a **route param**.

:::

At the moment, we are not doing anything with the `category` value. We need to update our `news/$category.tsx` file to read the `category` value from the URL and use it to display the correct data.

In our case, the reason why we see the same content for each category is because we are not yet reading the `category` value from the URL.

Let's fix that.

## Reading route params with the `loader` function

To read the `category` value from the URL, we need to add something called a `loader` function to our `news/$category.tsx` file.

But what is a `loader` function?

::::note[Info]

## What is a `loader` function?

### Client vs. server code

Traditionally, React code is only ever executed by the **client**, or inside the user's browser.

This is great for creating engaging user interactions, but the problem is that many crucial website actions, such as loading database information or accessing route parameters, can only be done on the **server**.

The makers of Remix got around this problem by introducing the concept of `loader` functions:

```tsx
export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
	// Server-side code here...
}
```

### Accessing server data with `loader` functions

Any code placed inside a Remix `loader` function is only ever executed on the **server**.

To make this work two, things need to happen:

1. The `loader` function needs to be placed inside a **route** file (i.e. a `tsx` file inside the `routes` folder)

2. It should prefixed with the `export` keyword so that Remix can access it.

		```tsx mark="export "
		export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
			// Server-side code here...
		}
		```

Crucially, Remix will then execute this code on the server _**before**_ the user interface (UI) is rendered. This ensures that any required data is accessed and processed before the UI is presented by the browser.

:::tip

You'll notice the `loader` function is being passed a `request` object as an argument:

```tsx "{ request }"
export async function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  // ... more code here...
}
```

This `request` object carries crucial information about the incoming request to the server, such as the URL the user is trying to access, any search parameters they've included, headers, and more.

Think of it as a toolbox that the `loader` function uses to understand exactly what the user is asking for.
:::

You can learn more about `loader` functions via the [**Remix docs**](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/loader).

::::

At first, let's just log this value out to the console and see what it looks like.

Carefully add the following code to your `news/$category.tsx` file:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.$category.tsx"
+import { type LoaderFunctionArgs, json } from '@remix-run/node'
+
+export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
+	const { category } = params
+
+	console.log({ category })
+
+	return json({})
+}

export default function NewsCategoryPage() {
	return (
		<div className="container py-16">
			<h2 className="text-h2">Generic news category page</h2>
		</div>
	)
}
```

Head back to your browser and click the links between the different news categories.

Now check your VS Code terminal. You should see the `category` value logged out each time you click a link:

![Logging route params](src/assets/png/logging-route-params.png)

## Passing data to the page

Success! We are now reading the `category` value from the URL ðŸŽ‰. We can use this value to fetch the correct data for our page.

Let's update the `loader` function so it returns this value in title-case as part of the `json` response.

::::caution

After updating the code below, you'll see a red line under `category` because TypeScript doesn't know what data type it is.

Don't worry about this yet - we can fix it later.

For now, let's just return the `categoryTitle` value as part of the `json` response.

:::danger[Extra care]

***Remember - take extra care to delete lines that are highlighted in red, and add the new lines in green exactly where shown.***

:::

::::

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.$category.tsx" ins="{ categoryTitle }"
import { json, type LoaderFunctionArgs } from '@remix-run/node'
+import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'

+function toTitleCase(str: string) {
+	return str
+		.toLowerCase()
+		.split('-')
+		.map(function (word) {
+			return word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1)
+		})
+		.join(' ')
+}
+
export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
	const { category } = params

-	console.log({ category })
+	const categoryTitle = toTitleCase(category)

-	return json({})
+	return json({ categoryTitle })
}

export default function NewsCategoryPage() {
+	const { categoryTitle } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

	return (
		<div className="container py-16">
-			<h2 className="text-h2">Generic news category page</h2>
+			<h2 className="text-h2">{categoryTitle}</h2>
		</div>
	)
}
```

:::note

#### Code review

That's a lot of changes! Let's break it down:

- We've added a new function called `toTitleCase` that takes a string and returns it in title-case format (in other words, with every first letter of a word capitalized).

	So, the string `technology` would become `Technology` and so on.

	```tsx
	function toTitleCase(str: string) {
		return str
			.toLowerCase()
			.split('-')
			.map(function (word) {
				return word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1)
			})
			.join(' ')
	}
	```
---
- We the call the `toTitleCase` function inside the `loader` function to convert the `category` value to title-case.
- We return the `categoryTitle` value as part of the `json` response.
```tsx {4, 6}
export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
	const { category } = params

	const categoryTitle = toTitleCase(category)

	return json({ categoryTitle })
}
```
---
- We call Remix's `useLoaderData` hook to read the `categoryTitle` value inside the `NewsCategoryPage` component on the browser.
```tsx
	const { categoryTitle } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
```
---
- We update the `h2` tag to display the `categoryTitle` value.
```tsx "{categoryTitle}"
		<h2 className="text-h2">{categoryTitle}</h2>
```

:::

## Checking the result

Now, head back to your browser and click the links between the different news categories again.

This time, you should see the title of the category displayed in every page, but we didn't need to hard-code a separate file for every one ðŸŽ‰:

![Custom title on every dynamic route](src/assets/gif/news-page-with-nav-links.gif)

## Fixing TypeScript errors

Finally, let's fix that TypeScript error we saw earlier.

We will do this using a package called [**Invariant**](https://github.com/zertosh/invariant). This package will help us to tell TypeScript that the `categoryTitle` value will always be a string.

First, `import` the package at the top of your `news.$category.tsx` file:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.$category.tsx"
+import { invariant } from '@epic-web/invariant'
import { json, type LoaderFunctionArgs } from '@remix-run/node'
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
```

Next, inside your `loader` function, add the following check:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.$category.tsx"
export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
	const { category } = params

+	invariant(typeof category === 'string', 'Category not found')
	const categoryTitle = toTitleCase(category)

	return json({ categoryTitle })
}
```

:::note[Understanding invariant]

As you can see, `invariant` is just a function that takes two arguments. The first argument is a condition that must be `true` for the overall code to continue.

```tsx "typeof category === 'string'"
invariant(typeof category === 'string', 'Category not found')
```

However, if the condition is `false`, then the function will throw an error with the message provided in the second argument.

```tsx "'Category not found'"
invariant(typeof category === 'string', 'Category not found')
```

:::

The red line has disappeared, and TypeScript now knows that `categoryTitle` will always be a string.

:::tip[Challenge]

## ðŸš€ Challenge

1. Try adding three-five new categories to your `news` route. You don't need to create a new file for each one - just add a new link to your `app/routes/index.tsx` file.
2. Update the layout of the `NewsCategoryPage` page by adding some dummy news story summary areas. These can be simple coloured rectangles at the moment to get an idea of layout. We will add real data to them later.

Use this code as a quick wireframe component to drop into your `NewsCategoryPage`:

```tsx
const WireframeBlock = () => {
	return (
		<div className="h-72 animate-pulse rounded-lg bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700" />
	)
}
```

You can then call this component multiple times in your `NewsCategoryPage` to create a wireframe layout. For example, if you wanted a five column layout, you could do this:

```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-5 gap-6">
	<WireframeBlock />
	<WireframeBlock />
	<WireframeBlock />
	<WireframeBlock />
	<WireframeBlock />
</div>
```

This will create a layout with five columns, each containing a wireframe block:

![Five Col Row](src/assets/gif/five-col-row.gif)

### ðŸš€ðŸš€ Extra Credit 1

1. Can you add a second row of wireframe blocks to your layout?

![Five col two rows](src/assets/png/epic-news/five-col-two-rows.png)

2. Can you use (**Tailwind's responsive class prefixes**)[https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design] to make your layout responsive? On small screens, you should only show two columns, but on larger screens you should show five.

![Five to two col responsive](src/assets/gif/five-to-two-col-responsive.gif)

### ðŸš€ðŸš€ Extra Credit 2

Can you make your responsive layouts more complex, where different rows respond in different ways to changing screen sizes?

![Grid complex responsive](src/assets/gif/grid-complex-responsive.gif)

**TIPS**:

1. Think carefully about how to arrange your parent `div` structures to wrap the various child `WireframeBlock` components inside them.
2. When working with child elements inside a `grid` parent, you can specify how many columns and rows a child element should span using the `col-span-` and `row-span-` classes. For example, look at the code below:

```tsx
<div className="col-span-1 sm:col-span-2 sm:row-span-2 lg:col-span-3">
	<WireframeBlock isPrimary />
</div>
```

Notice a few things:

1. I have wrapped the `WireframeBlock` component in a `div` element so that I can apply the `col-span-` and `row-span-` classes to it.
2. The `col-span-1` class specifies that this element should span one column on the very smallest screens.
3. `sm:col-span-2` specifies that this element should span two ***columns*** on **small** screens (640px width) and above.
4. `sm:row-span-2` specifies that it should span two ***rows*** on **small** screens (640px width) and above.
5. `lg:col-span-3` specifies that it should span three columns on *large* (1024px width) screens and above.
6. I've also updated the `WireframeBlock` component to accept a prop called `isPrimary` that will change the height of the block like so:

```tsx
interface WireframeBlockProps {
	isPrimary?: boolean
}

const WireframeBlock = ({ isPrimary = false }: WireframeBlockProps) => {
	return (
		<div
			className={`${isPrimary ? 'h-36 sm:h-[19.5rem]' : 'h-36'} animate-pulse rounded-lg bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700`}
		/>
	)
}
```

Have a play with various values and classes, and see what interesting layouts you can come up with!
