title: Routes and Remix's file structure
description: Remix's file structure and how it relates to routes in the application

import MonsterReveal from "src/components/MonsterReveal.astro";
import MonsterKbd from "src/components/MonsterKbd.astro";

As we learned in the [**`Outlet` component lesson**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/routing/outlet), Remix uses a [**file-based routing**](https://thevalleyofcode.com/remix/3-file-based-routing) system. This means that the file structure of your project maps directly to the URL structure of your app.

But what else does this convention allow us to do?

## Sibling routes

All files inside the `routes` folder are children of the `root.tsx` file. This means that the `root.tsx` file is the **parent** for the whole app.

<FileTree>

- app
	- root.tsx // parent route
	- routes
		- _index.tsx // child route

</FileTree>

However, files that sit at the same level as others within the `routes` folder are called **siblings**.

Any file that we add next to the `_index.tsx` file will become its **sibling**, and direct **children** of `root.tsx`:

<FileTree>

- app
	- routes
		- _index.tsx
		- about-us.tsx // sibling route
		- contact.tsx // sibling route

</FileTree>

For example, head back over to your browser, and type in the URL `http://localhost:3000/news`. Hit return and you should see a page not found message:

![Page not found](src/assets/png/page-not-found.png)

This is to be expected. We haven't created a route file for `/news` yet. Let's create a new file called `news.tsx` in the `routes` folder and add the following code to it:

```tsx title="app/routes/news.tsx"
export default function NewsPage() {
	return (
		<main className="flex flex-col py-24">
			<div className="container">
				<h1 className="text-h1">News</h1>
			</div>
		</main>
	)
}

```

:::caution[ðŸ¤” Stuck?]

If you can't remember how to add a new route file in Remix, revisit the [**`Outlet` component lesson**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/routing/outlet#adding-a-new-route) for a refresher.

:::

Save the file and head back to your browser. Refresh the page and you should see the new "News" page:

![News page](src/assets/png/news-page.png)

The `root.tsx` file is still rendering the code for the header and footer, but now the `Outlet` component we placed [**earlier**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/routing/outlet#the-outlet-component) is rendering the `NewsPage` component as its child route.

<NestedRouting childFilename="news.tsx" childUrl="/news"/>

:::caution[Important - Remix route conventions]

There are some golden rules to follow when creating route files in Remix:

- The file name must end with a `.tsx` extension
- It must be placed inside the `routes` folder
- It must `export` a React component as the _default export_, e.g.
		```tsx title="app/routes/news.tsx" mark="export default "
		export default function NewsPage() {
			// component code here
		}
		```
- The file name must match the route URL, e.g.
	- `routes/news.tsx` maps to `/news`.
	- `routes/about-us.tsx` maps to the `/about-us` URL.
	- Spelling, case and special characters are important.

		If we named the file `AboutUs.tsx`, then the URL would be `/AboutUs`, which is not what we want in a web app.

![Remix route conventions](src/assets/png/about-us-file-to-route.png)

<NestedRouting childFilename="about-us.tsx" childUrl="/about-us"/>

:::

## Nested routes

What if we want to create a page for each news **_category_**, e.g. `/news/technology`, `/news/sport`, `/news/entertainment` etc?

In Remix, this is achieved through a combination of ***nested*** and ***dynamic*** routes, where one route becomes the **child** of another.

<Steps>

1. Add another file to the `routes` folder called `news.$category.tsx`:

		![Add news category file](src/assets/webp/epic-news/add-news-category-file.webp)

2. Inside your new `news/$category.tsx` file, add the following code:

		```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.$category.tsx"
		+export default function NewsCategoryPage() {
		+	return (
		+		<div className="container py-16">
		+			<h2 className="text-h2">Generic news category page</h2>
		+		</div>
		+	)
		+}
		```

3. Open `app/routes/news.tsx`.

		To see a **child** route rendered in the browser at `/news`, we also need to add an `Outlet` component to this file, just like we did earlier in the `root.tsx` file.

		 Add the code below to `app/routes/news.tsx`:

		```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.tsx"
		+import { Outlet } from '@remix-run/react'

		export default function NewsPage() {
			return (
				<main className="flex flex-col py-24">
					<div className="container">
						<h1 className="text-h1">News</h1>
					</div>
		+
		+			<Outlet />
				</main>
			)
		}
		```

4. Save the file again and head back to your browser.

		You should now see the `news.$category.tsx` route rendered as a child of the "News" page:

		![Technology news page](src/assets/webp/epic-news/news-category-page.webp)

</Steps>

## Adding navigation links

Let's add a sub-navigation menu to the parent news page.

<Steps>

1. Open `news.tsx`.

		Add the code shown below:

		```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.tsx" ins="NavLink, "
		import { NavLink, Outlet } from '@remix-run/react'

		export default function NewsPage() {
			return (
				<main className="flex flex-col py-24">
					<div className="container">
						<h1 className="text-h1">News</h1>
		+				<div className="flex space-x-4 py-4">
		+					<NavLink
		+						to="technology"
		+						prefetch="intent"
		+						className={({ isActive }) =>
		+							`${isActive ? 'text-blue-300 underline underline-offset-8' : 'text-blue-500'}`
		+						}
		+					>
		+						Technology
		+					</NavLink>
		+				</div>
					</div>

					<Outlet />
				</main>
			)
		}
		```

</Steps>


:::note[The NavLink component]

The `NavLink` component is a special Remix `<Link>` that knows whether it is **"active"** or not via a special `isActive` boolean that Remix supplies for us.

If the user is on the page that the `NavLink` links to then `isActive` turns `true` and we can apply a different style to the link text via a callback function.

In the example here, we are applying a lighter blue color to the text and an underline to the link when it is active:

```jsx mark={5}
<NavLink
	to="technology"
	prefetch="intent"
	className={({ isActive }) =>
		`${isActive ? 'text-blue-300 underline underline-offset-8' : 'text-blue-500'}`
	}
>
	Technology
</NavLink>
```

#### More information

You can read more about the `NavLink` component [**here**](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/components/nav-link) in the Remix documentation.

## Code challenge

:::tip[Challenge]

1. Create further NavLinks for the following news categories in the `news.tsx` file:

	- Entertainment
	- Business
	- Reviews

	When you've finished, your final `NewsPage` component should behave something like this:

	![Single dynamic route](src/assets/gif/single-dynamic-route.gif)

	Don't worry that the child pages all have the same content. We will fix this in the next lesson.

## Updating the index page

Remember the code we [**commented out**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/routing/outlet#commenting-code-in-jsx) in `app/root.tsx`? Let's use it to update the `app/routes/_index.tsx` file.

<Steps>

1. Open `app/root.tsx`.

2. Select all the commented code, then cut it so it can be pasted elsewhere:

		![Cut commented code](src/assets/png/epic-news/cut-commented-code.png)

3. Open `app/routes/_index.tsx`.

		Replace the JSX currently inside the `return` statement brackets by pasting the copied code over it.

		```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
		import { type MetaFunction } from '@remix-run/node'

		export const meta: MetaFunction = () => [{ title: 'Epic News' }]

		export default function Index() {
			return (
	-			<main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
	-				<h1 className="text-mega">
	-					Hello from{' '}
	-					<pre className="prose rounded-lg bg-primary p-6 text-primary-foreground">
	-						app/routes/_index.tsx
	-					</pre>
	-				</h1>
	-			</main>
	+			{/* <main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
	+				<h1 className="text-mega">Your Journey Begins!</h1>
	+				<p className="text-base text-gray-600 md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
	+					Welcome to Epic News, where the latest developments in tech are found.
	+				</p>
	+			</main> */}
			)
		}
		```

4. Uncomment the code by removing `{/* ` and ` */}` from the beginning and end of the code block, then save it:

		```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx" del="{/* " del=" */}"
		import { type MetaFunction } from '@remix-run/node'

		export const meta: MetaFunction = () => [{ title: 'Epic News' }]

		export default function Index() {
			return (
				{/* <main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
					<h1 className="text-mega">Your Journey Begins!</h1>
					<p className="text-base text-gray-600 md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
						Welcome to Epic News, where the latest developments in tech are found.
					</p>
				</main> */}
			)
		}
		```

5. Fix all the broken imports that appear in the `app/routes/_index.tsx` file by adding the necessary imports at the top of the file.

6. Automatically sort the imports in both `app/routes/_index.tsx` and `app/routes/root.tsx` by using the VS Code keyboard shortcut <MonsterKbd>Shift + Alt + O</MonsterKbd> (on Windows) or <MonsterKbd>Shift + Option + O</MonsterKbd> (on Mac).

7. Visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

	You should see your original code from the [**`root.tsx`**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/root-tsx) lesson displayed on the page:

	![Index page with original code](src/assets/webp/epic-news/index-page-original-code.webp)

	:::note

	This is because any child root file that named `_index.tsx` will be rendered directly with the parent URL, in this case `http://localhost:3000/`.

	:::

	Remember this step for the next challenge!

## Fix the empty news page

We've got a little problem: if we visit `http://localhost:3000/news` directly, the page looks pretty empty:

![Empty news page](src/assets/webp/epic-news/empty-news-page.webp)

Using what you have learned about the `_index.tsx` special filename and Remix's [**file naming convention for parents and children**](#file-names-and-url-conventions), can you work out how to display the text below when someone visits the `http://localhost:3000/news` URL directly?

![News page with welcome text](src/assets/png/epic-news/news-page-welcome-text.png)

When the user clicks on a category, the welcome message shown in the screenshot above should be replaced with the category page.

You can use the code below for the news welcome page content.

```tsx title="Placeholder code for news welcome page"
export default function NewsPageIndex() {
	return (
		<main className="container py-24">
			<h2 className="text-4xl">
				Select a news category from the choices above...
			</h2>
		</main>
	)
}
```

The question is: where will you place it?

**TIP:** You will need to create a new file in the `routes` folder to solve this challenge. But what will you call it?

After you've had a go, check you solution with the one below.

<MonsterReveal>

Because the `news.tsx` file is the **parent** route, we can follow Remix's naming conventions and create a file called `news._index.tsx` to render the welcome message when the user visits the `/news` URL:

```tsx title="app/routes/news._index.tsx"
export default function NewsPageIndex() {
	return (
		<main className="container py-24">
			<h2 className="text-4xl">
				Select a news category from the choices above...
			</h2>
		</main>
	)
}
```

With this code in place, when the user visits `http://localhost:3000/news`, they will see the welcome message displayed on the page, and this will then be replaced by the different category pages when they click on a link:

![News index with categories](src/assets/gif/news-index-with-categories.gif)

</MonsterReveal>

:::

## Summary

In this lesson, we have:

- looked at how Remix's file structure and naming conventions map to the URL structure of application paths in the browser
- reviewed how the `root.tsx` file is the **parent** layout module for the whole app, and how **sibling** and **child** routes are created by adding files to the `routes` folder
- looked at how to create a nested route by naming a file with a period (`.`) in it
- learned how to render the child route in the parent route using the `Outlet` component
- seen, in the 'Extra Credit' solution above, how to use the `_index.tsx` naming convention to render a welcome message when the user visits the parent route URL.
- learned how to use the `NavLink` component to create navigation links between the different routes, and how to apply different styles to the links when they are active.

## What's next?

In the next tutorial, we will look at how to incorporate dynamic routes into our app, and how access the dynamic parts of the URL inside a `loader` function.
