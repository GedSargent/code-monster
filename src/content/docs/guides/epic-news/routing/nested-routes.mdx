title: Routes and Remix's file structure
description: Remix's file structure and how it relates to routes in the application

import NestedRouting from "src/components/epicNews/NestedRouting.astro";

As we looked at in the [**`Outlet` component lesson**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/routing/outlet), Remix uses a [**file-based routing**](https://thevalleyofcode.com/remix/3-file-based-routing) system. This means that the file structure of your project maps directly to the URL structure of your app.

But how does it map exactly? Let's take a look at the file structure of the Epic News app to see how it relates to the URL structure.

The Epic News app uses an NPM package called `remix-flat-routes` which you can read about in detail [**here**](https://github.com/kiliman/remix-flat-routes). Below is a summary of it's main naming conventions for mapping project files to URL routes:

## The root route

`root.tsx`, and by extension `_index.tsx` once we add the `Outlet` component to it, maps to `/` (or the base URL of the app - `http://localhost:3000/` in our case).

If you remember from our previous lesson, the `Outlet` component is used to render the **child** routes of the current parent. This means that the `root.tsx` file is the **parent** for all other routes in the app.

## Sibling routes

Files that sit at the same level as others in the `routes` folder are called **siblings**. Any file that we add next to the `_index.tsx` file will map to a sibling route of the root route.

For example, head back over to your browser, and type in the URL `http://localhost:3000/news`. Hit return and you should see a page not found message:

![Page not found](src/assets/png/page-not-found.png)

This is to be expected. We haven't created a route file for `/news` yet. Let's create a new file called `news.tsx` in the `routes` folder and add the following code to it:

```tsx title="app/routes/news.tsx"
export default function NewsPage() {
	return (
		<main className="flex flex-col p-24">
			<div className="container">
				<h1 className="text-h1">News</h1>
			</div>
		</main>
	)
}

```

Save the file and head back to your browser. Refresh the page and you should see the new "News" page:

![News page](src/assets/png/news-page.png)

See how the navbar and footer remain the same?

This is because the `root.tsx` file is still rendering the code for the header and footer, but the `Outlet` component we placed between these elements [**earlier**](http://localhost:4321/code-monster/guides/epic-news/routing/outlet#the-outlet-component) is now rendering the `NewsPage` component as the child route.

:::caution[Important - Remix route conventions]

What we have created here is known as a **UI Route**. There are other types of route in Remix, but we don't need to worry about them for now.

What _is_ important are the following conventions:

- A UI route file must have a `.tsx` extension
- It must be placed inside the `routes` folder
- It must `export` a React component as the _default export_
- The file name must match the route URL, e.g.
	- `routes/news.tsx` maps to `/news`.
	- `routes/about-us.tsx` maps to the `/about-us` URL.
	- Spelling, case and special characters are important. If we named the file `AboutUs.tsx`, then the URL would be `/AboutUs`, which is not what we want in a web app.

![Remix route conventions](src/assets/png/about-us-file-to-route.png)

These are crucial Remix conventions to remember. They form part of its file-based routing system, and allow Remix to render the correct component when the route is visited.

## Nested routes

So far, we've only used the `Outlet` component in the `root.tsx` file. But what if we want to create a *nested route*? For example, what if we want to create a page for each news **_category_**, e.g. `/news/technology`, `/news/sport`, `/news/entertainment` etc?

Lets add another file to the `routes` folder called `news.technology.tsx`. Add the following code to it:

```tsx title="app/routes/news.technology.tsx"
export default function TechnologyNewsPage() {
	return (
		<div className="container py-16">
			<h2 className="text-h2">Technology News</h2>
		</div>
	)
}
```

Now, head back to your browser and type in the URL `http://localhost:3000/news/technology`. Hit return and...wait, what? The page stays the same?!

:::note[Getting started with nested routes]

### File names and URL conventions

The problem here is that `news.tsx` and `news.technology.tsx` both have names that share the same base path: `/news`. The period (`.`) in the filename `news.technology.tsx` is what tells Remix that this file is a *child* of the `news` route.

By naming our files in this way, we have promoted the `news.tsx` file to be a **parent layout route module**, just like `root.tsx` is the parent layout module for the whole app.

:::

### Adding `Outlet` to the parent route

To see the **child** route code rendered in the browser, we need to add an `Outlet` component to the **parent** `news.tsx` file, just like we did earlier in the `root.tsx` file.

Let's head back to `app/routes/news.tsx` and add one now:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.tsx"
+import { Outlet } from '@remix-run/react'

export default function NewsPage() {
	return (
		<main className="flex flex-col p-24">
			<div className="container">
				<h1 className="text-h1">News</h1>
			</div>
+
+			<Outlet />
		</main>
	)
}
```

Save the file again and head back to your browser. You should now see the "Technology News" route rendered as a child of the "News" page:

![Technology news page](src/assets/png/tech-news-page.png)

## Adding a navigation link

Let's finish by adding a nav link to the technology news page in the `NewsPage` component:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.tsx" ins="NavLink, "
import { NavLink, Outlet } from '@remix-run/react'

export default function NewsPage() {
	return (
		<main className="flex flex-col p-24">
			<div className="container">
				<h1 className="text-h1">News</h1>
+				<div className="flex space-x-4 py-4">
+					<NavLink
+						to="technology"
+						className={({ isActive }) =>
+							`${isActive ? 'text-blue-300 underline underline-offset-8' : 'text-blue-500'}`
+						}
+					>
+						Technology
+					</NavLink>
+				</div>
			</div>

			<Outlet />
		</main>
	)
}
```

:::note[The NavLink component]

The `NavLink` component is a special Remix `<Link>` that knows whether it is **"active"** or not.

If it is **active** (i.e. the user is on the page that the `NavLink` links to), then we can apply a different style to it via a callback function.

In the example here, we are applying a lighter blue color to the text and an underline to the link when it is active:

```jsx
<NavLink
	to="technology"
	className={({ isActive }) =>
		`${isActive ? 'text-blue-300 underline underline-offset-8' : 'text-blue-500'}`
	}
>
	Technology
</NavLink>
```

#### More information

You can read more about the `NavLink` component [**here**](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/components/nav-link) in the Remix documentation.

:::tip[Challenge]

Using your knowledge of parent/child routes and the `NavLink` component, add links to the other news categories in the `NewsPage` component:

- Entertainment
- Business
- Reviews

At the moment, the page just needs to render the name of the category in an `h2` tag, just like the `TechnologyNewsPage` component does. If you want to go further in your page design, feel free to do so!

When you've finished, your final `NewsPage` component should behave something like this:

## Summary

In this lesson, we've looked at how Remix's file structure and naming conventions map to the URL structure of application paths in the browser.

We've reviewed how the `root.tsx` file is the **parent** layout module for the whole app, and how **sibling** and **child** routes are created by adding files to the `routes` folder.

We looked at how to create a nested route by naming a file with a period (`.`) in it, and how to render the child route in the parent route using the `Outlet` component.

Finally, we've seen how to use the `NavLink` component to create navigation links between the different routes, and how to apply different styles to the links when they are active.
