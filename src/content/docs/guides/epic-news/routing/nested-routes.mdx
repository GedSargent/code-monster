As we learned in the [**`Outlet` component lesson**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/routing/outlet), Remix uses a [**file-based routing**](https://thevalleyofcode.com/remix/3-file-based-routing) system. This means that the file structure of your project maps directly to the URL structure of your app.

But what else does this convention allow us to do?

Let's review how the file structure of the Epic News app relates to the URL structure.

## The "root" route and the base URL

The `root.tsx` file, and by extension `_index.tsx` (once we add the `Outlet` component to `root.tsx`), maps to `/`, or the base URL of the app - `http://localhost:3000/` in our case.

<NestedRouting />

If the app was deployed to a live website, the base URL would be the domain name of the site, e.g. `https://epicnews.com/`.

If you remember from our previous lesson, the `Outlet` component is used to render the **child** routes of the current parent at a specific place in the UI.

So in effect, this means that the `root.tsx` file is actually the **parent** for ***every*** other route in the app. Any code we add here will be globally applied to all the other routes.

But what if we could add more parent and child routes to a Remix app? How could we show Remix know which files are ***parents*** and which are their ***children***?

The answer lies in the naming conventions of the files themselves.

## Sibling routes

Files that sit at the same level as others in the `routes` folder are called **siblings**.

Any files that we add next to the `_index.tsx` file will become **siblings** of `_index.tsx`, and direct **children** of `root.tsx`:

![Parent and sibling routes](src/assets/png/epic-news/parent-and-sibling-routes@2x.png)

For example, head back over to your browser, and type in the URL `http://localhost:3000/news`. Hit return and you should see a page not found message:

![Page not found](src/assets/png/page-not-found.png)

This is to be expected. We haven't created a route file for `/news` yet. Let's create a new file called `news.tsx` in the `routes` folder and add the following code to it:

```tsx title="app/routes/news.tsx"
export default function NewsPage() {
	return (
		<main className="flex flex-col py-24">
			<div className="container">
				<h1 className="text-h1">News</h1>
			</div>
		</main>
	)
}

```

Save the file and head back to your browser. Refresh the page and you should see the new "News" page:

![News page](src/assets/png/news-page.png)

See how the navbar and footer remain the same?

This is because the `root.tsx` file is still rendering the code for the header and footer, but now the `Outlet` component we placed between these elements [**earlier**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/routing/outlet#the-outlet-component) is rendering the `NewsPage` component as the child route.

<NestedRouting childFilename="news.tsx" childUrl="/news"/>

:::caution[Important - Remix route conventions]

What we have created here is known as a **UI Route**. There are other types of route in Remix, but we don't need to worry about them for now.

What _is_ important are the following conventions:

- A UI route file must be named with a `.tsx` extension
- It must be placed inside the `routes` folder
- It must `export` a React component as the _default export_, e.g.
		```tsx title="app/routes/news.tsx" mark="export default "
		export default function NewsPage() {
			// component code here
		}
		```
- The file name must match the route URL, e.g.
	- `routes/news.tsx` maps to `/news`.
	- `routes/about-us.tsx` maps to the `/about-us` URL.
	- Spelling, case and special characters are important.

		If we named the file `AboutUs.tsx`, then the URL would be `/AboutUs`, which is not what we want in a web app.

![Remix route conventions](src/assets/png/about-us-file-to-route.png)

<NestedRouting childFilename="about-us.tsx" childUrl="/about-us"/>

These are crucial Remix conventions to remember. They form part of its file-based routing system, and allow Remix to render the correct component when the route is visited.

:::

## Nested routes

What if we want to create a page for each news **_category_**, e.g. `/news/technology`, `/news/sport`, `/news/entertainment` etc?

In Remix, this is achieved through *nested routes*, where one route becomes the **child** of another.

Lets add another file to the `routes` folder called `news.technology.tsx`.

![Add News Tech route file](src/assets/png/epic-news/add-news-tech-route-file.png)

Once created, add the following code to it:

```tsx title="app/routes/news.technology.tsx"
export default function TechnologyNewsPage() {
	return (
		<div className="container py-16">
			<h2 className="text-h2">Technology News</h2>
		</div>
	)
}
```

:::note[Getting started with nested routes]

### File names and URL conventions

The files `news.tsx` and `news.technology.tsx` both have names that share the same ***base path***: `/news`.

The period (`.`) in the filename `news.technology.tsx` is what tells Remix that this file is a *child* of the `news` route.

By naming our files in this way, we have promoted the `news.tsx` file to be a **parent layout route module**, just like `root.tsx` is the parent layout module for the whole app.

![Parent and child routes](src/assets/png/file-names-and-url-conventions.png)

:::

Now, head back to your browser and type in the URL `http://localhost:3000/news/technology`. Hit return and...

Wait, what? The page stays the same?!

![Technology news page not showing](src/assets/png/news-tech-no-outlet.png)

Let's fix this by adding an `Outlet` component to the `news.tsx` file.

### Adding `Outlet` to the parent route

To see the **child** route code rendered in the browser, we need to add an `Outlet` component to the **parent** `news.tsx` file, just like we did earlier in the `root.tsx` file.

Let's head back to `app/routes/news.tsx` and add one now:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.tsx"
+import { Outlet } from '@remix-run/react'

export default function NewsPage() {
	return (
		<main className="flex flex-col py-24">
			<div className="container">
				<h1 className="text-h1">News</h1>
			</div>
+
+			<Outlet />
		</main>
	)
}
```

Save the file again and head back to your browser. You should now see the "Technology News" route rendered as a child of the "News" page:

![Technology news page](src/assets/png/tech-news-page.png)

## Adding a navigation link

Let's finish by adding a nav link to the technology news page in the `NewsPage` component:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/news.tsx" ins="NavLink, "
import { NavLink, Outlet } from '@remix-run/react'

export default function NewsPage() {
	return (
		<main className="flex flex-col py-24">
			<div className="container">
				<h1 className="text-h1">News</h1>
+				<div className="flex space-x-4 py-4">
+					<NavLink
+						to="technology"
+						prefetch="intent"
+						className={({ isActive }) =>
+							`${isActive ? 'text-blue-300 underline underline-offset-8' : 'text-blue-500'}`
+						}
+					>
+						Technology
+					</NavLink>
+				</div>
			</div>

			<Outlet />
		</main>
	)
}
```

:::note[The NavLink component]

The `NavLink` component is a special Remix `<Link>` that knows whether it is **"active"** or not via a special `isActive` boolean that Remix supplies for us.

If the user is on the page that the `NavLink` links to then `isActive` turns `true` and we can apply a different style to the link text via a callback function.

In the example here, we are applying a lighter blue color to the text and an underline to the link when it is active:

```jsx mark={5}
<NavLink
	to="technology"
	prefetch="intent"
	className={({ isActive }) =>
		`${isActive ? 'text-blue-300 underline underline-offset-8' : 'text-blue-500'}`
	}
>
	Technology
</NavLink>
```

You can read more about the `NavLink` component [**here**](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/components/nav-link) in the Remix documentation.

## Code challenges

::::tip[Challenge]

1. Using your knowledge of parent/child routes, create route files to other news categories in the `NewsPage` component:

	- Entertainment
	- Business
	- Reviews

	For each new route, add links to your navbar and footer.

	At the moment, each page just needs to render the name of the category in an `h2` tag, just like the `TechnologyNewsPage` component. If you want to go further in your page design, feel free to do so!

	When you've finished, your final `NewsPage` component should behave something like this:

![News page with nav links](src/assets/gif/news-page-with-nav-links.gif)

2. Remember the code we [**commented out**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/routing/outlet#commenting-code-in-jsx) in `app/root.tsx`? Open the file, select all the commented code, then cut it so it can be pasted elsewhere:

![Cut commented code](src/assets/png/epic-news/cut-commented-code.png)

	Open `app/routes/_index.tsx`. Replace the JSX currnetly inside the `return` statement brackets by pasting the copied code over it.

	```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
	import { type MetaFunction } from '@remix-run/node'

	export const meta: MetaFunction = () => [{ title: 'Epic News' }]

	export default function Index() {
		return (
-			<main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
-				<h1 className="text-mega">
-					Hello from{' '}
-					<pre className="prose rounded-lg bg-primary p-6 text-primary-foreground">
-						app/routes/_index.tsx
-					</pre>
-				</h1>
-			</main>
+			{/* <main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
+				<h1 className="text-mega">Your Journey Begins!</h1>
+				<p className="text-base text-gray-600 md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
+					Welcome to Epic News, where the latest developments in tech are found.
+				</p>
+			</main> */}
		)
	}
	```

3. Uncomment the code by removing `{/* ` and ` */}` from the beginning and end of the code block, then save it:

	```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx" del="{/* " del=" */}"
	import { type MetaFunction } from '@remix-run/node'

	export const meta: MetaFunction = () => [{ title: 'Epic News' }]

	export default function Index() {
		return (
			{/* <main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
				<h1 className="text-mega">Your Journey Begins!</h1>
				<p className="text-base text-gray-600 md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
					Welcome to Epic News, where the latest developments in tech are found.
				</p>
			</main> */}
		)
	}
	```

	4. Fix all the broken imports that appear in the `app/routes/_index.tsx` file by adding the necessary imports at the top of the file:

	5. Automatically sort the imports in both `app/routes/_index.tsx` and `app/routes/root.tsx` by using VS Code's built-in [**auto-sort keyboard shortcut**](#auto-sort-imports).

:::note[Info]

### Auto-sort imports

It's very easy for imports to become disorganised over time. This can lead to unnecessary merge conflicts in Git when working in a team, or across multiple machines.

If you use the VS Code keyboard shortcut <MonsterKbd>Shift + Alt + O</MonsterKbd> (on Windows) or <MonsterKbd>Shift + Option + O</MonsterKbd> (on Mac) to organize your imports, it will also sort the `import` statements in your file whenever you need to.

Try it now in your `app/root.tsx` file to see how it works!

![Auto sort imports](src/assets/gif/auto-sort-imports.gif)

Just remember to save your file afterwards to keep the changes!

:::

If you visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser, you should see your original code from the [**`root.tsx`**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/root-tsx) lesson displayed on the page:

![Index page with original code](src/assets/png/epic-news/index-page-original-code.png)

This is because any child root file that named `_index.tsx` will be rendered directly with the parent URL, in this case `http://localhost:3000/`.

Remember this step for the next challenge!

### 🚀 Extra credit

We've got a little problem: if we visit `http://localhost:3000/news` directly, the page looks pretty empty:

![Empty news page](src/assets/png/epic-news/empty-news-page.png)

Using what you have learned about the `_index.tsx` special filename and Remix's [**file naming convention for parents and children**](#file-names-and-url-conventions), can you work out how to display the text below when someone visits the `http://localhost:3000/news` URL directly?

![News page with welcome text](src/assets/png/epic-news/news-page-welcome-text.png)

When the user clicks on a category, the welcome message above should be replaced with the category page.

You can use the code below for the news welcome page content.

```tsx title="app/routes/news._index.tsx"
export default function NewsPageIndex() {
	return (
		<main className="container py-24">
			<h2 className="text-4xl">
				Select a news category from the choices above...
			</h2>
		</main>
	)
}
```

The question is: where will you place it?

**TIP:** You will need to create a new file in the `routes` folder to solve this challenge. But what will you call it?

After you've had a go, check you solution with the one below.

<MonsterReveal>

Because the `news.tsx` file is the **parent** route, we can follow Remix's naming conventions and create a file called `news._index.tsx` to render the welcome message when the user visits the `/news` URL:

```tsx title="app/routes/news._index.tsx"
export default function NewsPageIndex() {
	return (
		<main className="container py-24">
			<h2 className="text-4xl">
				Select a news category from the choices above...
			</h2>
		</main>
	)
}
```

With this code in place, when the user visits `http://localhost:3000/news`, they will see the welcome message displayed on the page, and this will then be replaced by the different category pages when they click on a link:

![News index with categories](src/assets/gif/news-index-with-categories.gif)

</MonsterReveal>

## Summary

In this lesson, we have:

- looked at how Remix's file structure and naming conventions map to the URL structure of application paths in the browser
- reviewed how the `root.tsx` file is the **parent** layout module for the whole app, and how **sibling** and **child** routes are created by adding files to the `routes` folder
- looked at how to create a nested route by naming a file with a period (`.`) in it
- learned how to render the child route in the parent route using the `Outlet` component
- seen, in the 'Extra Credit' solution above, how to use the `_index.tsx` naming convention to render a welcome message when the user visits the parent route URL.
- learned how to use the `NavLink` component to create navigation links between the different routes, and how to apply different styles to the links when they are active.

## What's next?

In the next tutorial, we will look at how to incorporate dynamic routes into our app, and how access the dynamic parts of the URL inside a `loader` function.
