## Introduction

In this guide, we will update the layout of the `NewsCategoryPage` page by adding some dummy news story summary areas.

These will be simple coloured rectangles at the moment to get a general idea of layout. We will add real data to them later.

## Getting started

Use the code below as a quick wireframe component.

Copy and paste it into your `app/routes/news.$category.tsx` file, directly above the `NewsCategoryPage` component:

:::caution[Red underline]

Ignore the red line under `WireframeBlock` that appears when you paste the code below - this is because we haven't actually called the component yet.

We will do this in the next step.

:::

```diff lang=tsx title="app/routes/news.$category.tsx" showLineNumbers collapse={1-13}
import { invariant } from '@epic-web/invariant'
import { type LoaderFunctionArgs, json } from '@remix-run/node'
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
import { toTitleCase } from '~/utils/stringUtils.ts'

export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
	const { category } = params

	invariant(typeof category === 'string', 'Category not found')
	const categoryTitle = toTitleCase(category)

	return json({ categoryTitle })
}

+const WireframeBlock = () => {
+  return (
+    <div className="h-72 animate-pulse rounded-lg bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700" />
+  )
+}

export default function NewsCategoryPage() {
	const { categoryTitle } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

	return (
		<div className="container py-16">
			<h2 className="text-h2">{categoryTitle}</h2>
		</div>
	)
}
```

You can then call this component multiple times in your `NewsCategoryPage` to create a wireframe layout. For example, if you wanted a five column layout, you could do this:

```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-5 gap-6">
	<WireframeBlock />
	<WireframeBlock />
	<WireframeBlock />
	<WireframeBlock />
	<WireframeBlock />
</div>
```

This will create a layout with five columns, each containing a wireframe block:

### Wireframe layout

1. Can you add a second row of wireframe blocks to your layout?

2. Can you use [**Tailwind's responsive class prefixes**](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) to make your layout responsive? On small screens, you should only show two columns, but on larger screens you should show five.

### ðŸš€ðŸš€ Extra Credit (Optional)

This is a bit more tricky.

Can you make your responsive layouts more complex, where different rows respond in different ways to changing screen sizes?

**TIPS**:

1. Think carefully about how to arrange your parent `div` structures to wrap the various child `WireframeBlock` components inside them.
2. When working with child elements inside a `grid` parent, you can specify how many columns and rows a child element should span using the `col-span-` and `row-span-` classes. For example, look at the code below:

```tsx
<div className="col-span-1 sm:col-span-2 sm:row-span-2 lg:col-span-3">
	<WireframeBlock isPrimary />
</div>
```

Notice a few things:

1. I have wrapped the `WireframeBlock` component in a `div` element so that I can apply the `col-span-` and `row-span-` classes to it.
2. The `col-span-1` class specifies that this element should span one column on the very smallest screens.
3. `sm:col-span-2` specifies that this element should span two ***columns*** on **small** screens (640px width) and above.
4. `lg:col-span-3` specifies that it should span three columns on *large* (1024px width) screens and above.
5. I've also updated the `WireframeBlock` component to accept a prop called `isPrimary` that will change the height of the block like so:

```tsx
interface WireframeBlockProps {
	isPrimary?: boolean
}

const WireframeBlock = ({ isPrimary = false }: WireframeBlockProps) => {
	return (
		<div
			className={`${isPrimary ? 'h-36 sm:h-[19.5rem]' : 'h-36'} animate-pulse rounded-lg bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700`}
		/>
	)
}
```

Have a play with various values and classes, and see what interesting layouts you can come up with!

## Summary

In this step, we:

- Created a wireframe layout for the `NewsCategoryPage` using Tailwind CSS.
- Added a `WireframeBlock` component to create a simple coloured rectangle to represent a news story summary.
- Completed a challenge to create a wireframe layout for the `NewsCategoryPage` using Tailwind CSS.

## Next steps

Our site is beginning to take shape!

We have a home page and a shared layout for our news category page.

In the next step, we will think about securing our website against some common modern security threats.
