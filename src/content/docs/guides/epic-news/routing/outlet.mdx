title: ðŸ”€ Routing - `Outlet` and `_index.tsx`
description: Learn how to create a nested route with the 'Outlet' component and the '_index.tsx' file.

import NestedRouting from "src/components/epicNews/NestedRouting.astro";
import MonsterKbd from "src/components/MonsterKbd.astro";

At the moment, we have only been working on one page in our app, but of course we want to add more.

So far, we've been using the `root.tsx` file to render what appears to be a single page. But looks can be deceiving: this little file is deceptively powerful!

As you'll see, the `root.tsx` file is actually the springboard from which we can render a shared _layout_ that all of our other pages depend on.

## The `Outlet` component

Let's start by swapping out everything between the `<main>` tags in our `root.tsx` file with a special component that Remix supplies for us: the `Outlet` component.

The easiest way to do this is to comment out the existing code. We will be using it again later, so <u>***don't delete it***</u>!

:::note[Commenting code]

### Commenting code in JSX

In JSX, you can comment out a block of code by wrapping it in `{/* */}`.

The easiest way to do this is to select the block of code you want to comment out, and then use the keyboard shortcut <MonsterKbd>Cmd + /</MonsterKbd> on Mac or <MonsterKbd>Ctrl + /</MonsterKbd> on Windows.

Save your changes and head back across to your browser, but *make sure you are on the home page at [**http://localhost:3000**](http://localhost:3000).*

You should see the screen content has changed:

![Hello from _index.tsx screenshot](src/assets/png/hello-from-index-tsx.png)

### Wait - what just happened? ðŸ¤”

Why can we still see the navbar and footer, but the central page content has changed? And where is this new code coming from?

Well - the screenshot itself provides a big clue to this last question!

Open the file at `app/routes/_index.tsx` and you'll find the matching code:

```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
import { type MetaFunction } from "@remix-run/node";

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => [{ title: "Epic News" }];

export default function Index() {
  return (
    <main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
      <h1 className="text-mega">
        Hello from{" "}
        <pre className="prose rounded-lg bg-primary p-6 text-primary-foreground">
          app/routes/_index.tsx
        </pre>
      </h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

So what exactly is happening here?? Why is the `Outlet` component rendering the `_index.tsx` file?

::::tip[Deep Dive]

## `Outlet` component deep dive

`Outlet` is a special Remix component that tells the browser to render a **child route** that matches the current URL.

This is a strange concept to grasp at first, so let's take some time to understand what is actually happening.

:::info

### 1. What is a "route"? ðŸ”€

In a normal web application, a "route" is a URL that corresponds to a specific **page** or **view** in the app. This is usually served from a specific file in the project.

For example, when we run a Remix application on our local machines, the **base URL** is

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

In a Remix app, this is initially served from the file at `app/root.tsx` - the very file we have been working on until now.

However, if we wanted to navigate to a different page - say the 'About Us' page - then we would typically add a new **path** onto the end of the base URL like so:

```bash ins="/about-us" title="URL for the 'About Us' page"
http://localhost:3000/about-us
```

The "route" in this case would then be served from another file in the code base. In a Remix app, this file would typically be found inside the `routes` folder, and called `about-us.tsx`.

### 2. Introducing "parent" and "child" routes

In a Remix application, we can make use of something much more powerful: "**parent**" and "**child**" routes.

A "child" route is nested _within_ another route, which we call a "parent".

As soon as we place the `Outlet` component inside a route file (like we just have in `root.tsx`), it becomes a "parent". The `Outlet` components tells Remix to render **both** the parent **and** the matching child route(s) through it.

#### The main index page of a website

In the case of our app at the moment, the `root.tsx` file is being served as the "parent" route, and the `_index.tsx` file is the "child" route.

The reason we can still see the navbar and footer is because this is code being served from the **parent** `root.tsx` file. However, the content that we see in the middle of the page is now being served from the `_index.tsx` file through the `Outlet` component as its child.

Hover your cursor over the two buttons below to see how this works in practice:

<NestedRouting />

::::

But how does Remix know which route files should be "children" of the parent? The answer lies in Remix's file naming conventions.

## The route structure

Routes in Remix are represented by files and folders in your project. The structure of your files and folders directly maps to the structure of your routes in the browser URL bar.

We can see this in action by adding a new route to our app. Let's add a dummy 'about us' page.

### Adding a new route

Create a new file at `app/routes/about-us.tsx`:

![About us page file](src/assets/png/add-new-route.png)

:::danger[Extra care]

### Route file names in Remix

Take extra care when naming your route files in Remix. The file name **must match** the URL path that you want to serve from it.

For example, because we want to serve a page from the URL path `/about-us`, then the file name must **also** be `about-us.tsx`.

If it was named `aboutUs.tsx` or `about_us.tsx`, then Remix would not be able to serve the page from the correct URL.

:::

Inside this new file, add the following code and save your changes:

```tsx title="app/routes/about-us.tsx"
export default function AboutUs() {
  return (
    <main className="container">
      <h1 className="text-mega">About us</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Head back over to your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/about-us](http://localhost:3000/about-us). You should see the new 'About us' page:

![About us page navigation](src/assets/gif/about-us-page.gif)

Notice how the navbar, footer and theme switcher are still present on the page? This is because `/about-us` is a direct child of the base URL (`/`, served from the `root.tsx` file), so the `Outlet` component in the `root.tsx` file serves the `about-us.tsx` code inside the parent.

Think of the `Outlet` component as a "window" or "placeholder" for the child route. It's a way of telling Remix where to render the child route **inside** the parent route.

This is a powerful feature of Remix that we will continue to explore in more detail later.

:::tip[Your turn]

### Challenge

Add a new routes to your app that serve pages from the URL paths below. For the time being, you can just add a simple title to each page in the same way we did for `/about-us`.

1. `/contact-us`
2. `/news`
3. `/account`

#### Extra credit ðŸš€ðŸš€

What other top-level pages do you think a site like Epic News might need? Add them to your app and give them each a simple placeholder title for the time being.
