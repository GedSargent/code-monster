## Introduction

At the moment, we have only been working on one page in our app, but of course we want to add more.

So far, we've been using the `root.tsx` file to render what appears to be a single page. But looks can be deceiving: this little file is very powerful!

As you'll see, the `root.tsx` file is actually the springboard from which we can render a shared _layout_ that all of our other pages depend on.

In this step, we will:

- Learn how to use the `Outlet` component to render child routes inside a parent route
- Create a new route file in Remix
- Understand how the file naming conventions in Remix map to the URL paths in the browser
- Add new routes to our app and see how they are served from the correct URL paths
- Complete a challenge to add multiple new routes to our app

## The `Outlet` component

Let's start by swapping out everything between the `<main>` tags in our `root.tsx` file with a special component that Remix supplies for us: the `Outlet` component.

::::danger

The easiest way to do this next part is to comment out the existing code.

We will be using the code again later, so <u>***don't delete it***</u>!

:::note[Commenting code]

### Commenting code in JSX

In JSX, you can comment out a block of code by wrapping it in `{/* */}`.

The easiest way to do this is to select the block of code you want to comment out, and then use the keyboard shortcut below:

<MonsterKbd>Cmd + /</MonsterKbd> on Mac or <MonsterKbd>Ctrl + /</MonsterKbd> on Windows.

:::

::::

<Steps>

1. Add the `Outlet` components as an extra import at the top of the `root.tsx` file:

		```diff lang="tsx" title="app/root.tsx" showLineNumbers ins="Outlet, " collapse={1-17}
		import { type LinksFunction } from '@remix-run/node'
		import { Outlet, useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
		import { ParallaxProvider } from 'react-scroll-parallax'
		import Document from '~/components/shared-layout/Document'
		import ThemeSwitch from '~/components/shared-layout/ThemeSwitch'
		import { useNonce } from '~/utils/nonce-provider.ts'
		import rootLinkElements from '~/utils/providers/rootLinkElements'
		import { type loader } from './__root.server'
		import FooterMenuRight from './components/organisms/Footer/FooterMenuRight'
		import HeaderWithSearch from './components/organisms/HeaderWithSearch'
		import useTheme from './hooks/useTheme.tsx'
		```

2. Comment out the all your code that is currently wrapped between the `div` with a `className` of `flex-1`. 

		This the opening and closing `<main>` tag, along with all its children.

		I've highlighted this code in white below - your actual code will likely look different here, as you have started to customise it.

				```diff lang="tsx" title="app/root.tsx" showLineNumbers collapse={1-17, 55-61} {31-52}
		import { type LinksFunction } from '@remix-run/node'
		import { Outlet, useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
		import { ParallaxProvider } from 'react-scroll-parallax'
		import Document from '~/components/shared-layout/Document'
		import ThemeSwitch from '~/components/shared-layout/ThemeSwitch'
		import { useNonce } from '~/utils/nonce-provider.ts'
		import rootLinkElements from '~/utils/providers/rootLinkElements'
		import { type loader } from './__root.server'
		import FooterMenuRight from './components/organisms/Footer/FooterMenuRight'
		import HeaderWithSearch from './components/organisms/HeaderWithSearch'
		import useTheme from './hooks/useTheme.tsx'

		export const links: LinksFunction = () => {
			return rootLinkElements
		}
		export { headers, meta } from './__root.client.tsx'
		export { action, loader } from './__root.server.tsx'

		export default function App() {
			const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
			const nonce = useNonce()
			const theme = useTheme()

			return (
				<ParallaxProvider>
					<Document nonce={nonce} theme={theme}>
						<div className="flex h-screen flex-col justify-between">
							<HeaderWithSearch />

							<div className="flex-1">
								{/* <main className="h-full">
									<ParallaxBackground
										image={heroImage}
										title="Epic News"
										logo={logo}
										altText="Welcome to Epic News, where the latest developments in tech are found."
									>
										<div className="mx-auto flex w-fit flex-1 flex-col justify-between gap-16 bg-secondary/40 px-28 py-16 backdrop-blur-sm">
											<p className="text-center text-4xl font-extrabold text-secondary-foreground">
												The latest tech news in one place
											</p>
											<div className="flex justify-center gap-8">
												<Button variant="default" size="wide">
													<Link to="/signup">Sign up</Link>
												</Button>
												<Button variant="secondary" size="wide">
													<Link to="/login">Login</Link>
												</Button>
											</div>
										</div>
									</ParallaxBackground>
								</main> */}
							</div>

							<div className="container flex justify-between pb-5">
								<ThemeSwitch userPreference={data.requestInfo.userPrefs.theme} />
							</div>

							<FooterMenuRight />
						</div>
					</Document>
				</ParallaxProvider>
			)
		}
		```

3. Add the `Outlet` component beneath the commented out code

		```diff lang="tsx" title="app/root.tsx" ins="Outlet, " showLineNumbers collapse={1-17, 32-51, 56-62} {31-52}
		import { type LinksFunction } from '@remix-run/node'
		import { Outlet, useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
		import { ParallaxProvider } from 'react-scroll-parallax'
		import Document from '~/components/shared-layout/Document'
		import ThemeSwitch from '~/components/shared-layout/ThemeSwitch'
		import { useNonce } from '~/utils/nonce-provider.ts'
		import rootLinkElements from '~/utils/providers/rootLinkElements'
		import { type loader } from './__root.server'
		import FooterMenuRight from './components/organisms/Footer/FooterMenuRight'
		import HeaderWithSearch from './components/organisms/HeaderWithSearch'
		import useTheme from './hooks/useTheme.tsx'

		export const links: LinksFunction = () => {
			return rootLinkElements
		}
		export { headers, meta } from './__root.client.tsx'
		export { action, loader } from './__root.server.tsx'

		export default function App() {
			const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
			const nonce = useNonce()
			const theme = useTheme()

			return (
				<ParallaxProvider>
					<Document nonce={nonce} theme={theme}>
						<div className="flex h-screen flex-col justify-between">
							<HeaderWithSearch />

							<div className="flex-1">
								{/* <main className="h-full">
									<ParallaxBackground
										image={heroImage}
										title="Epic News"
										logo={logo}
										altText="Welcome to Epic News, where the latest developments in tech are found."
									>
										<div className="mx-auto flex w-fit flex-1 flex-col justify-between gap-16 bg-secondary/40 px-28 py-16 backdrop-blur-sm">
											<p className="text-center text-4xl font-extrabold text-secondary-foreground">
												The latest tech news in one place
											</p>
											<div className="flex justify-center gap-8">
												<Button variant="default" size="wide">
													<Link to="/signup">Sign up</Link>
												</Button>
												<Button variant="secondary" size="wide">
													<Link to="/login">Login</Link>
												</Button>
											</div>
										</div>
									</ParallaxBackground>
								</main> */}
		+						<Outlet />
							</div>

							<div className="container flex justify-between pb-5">
								<ThemeSwitch userPreference={data.requestInfo.userPrefs.theme} />
							</div>

							<FooterMenuRight />
						</div>
					</Document>
				</ParallaxProvider>
			)
		}
		```

4. Save your changes and head back across to your browser, but *make sure you are on the home page at [**http://localhost:3000**](http://localhost:3000).*

		You should see the screen content has changed:

		![Hello from _index.tsx screenshot](src/assets/png/hello-from-index-tsx.png)

</Steps>

### Wait - what just happened? ðŸ¤”

Why can we still see the navbar and footer, but the central page content has changed? And where is this new code coming from?

Well - the screenshot itself provides a big clue to this last question!

Open the file at `app/routes/_index.tsx` and you'll find the matching code:

```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
import { type MetaFunction } from "@remix-run/node";

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => [{ title: "Epic News" }];

export default function Index() {
  return (
    <main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
      <h1 className="text-mega">
        Hello from{" "}
        <pre className="prose rounded-lg bg-primary p-6 text-primary-foreground">
          app/routes/_index.tsx
        </pre>
      </h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

So what exactly is happening here?? Why is the `Outlet` component rendering the `_index.tsx` file?

::::note[Deep Dive]

### What is a "route"? ðŸ”€

In a web app, a "route" is a web address (URL) that shows a specific page or view in the app. Every route is served from a specific file in the code base.

For example, when we run a Remix application on our local machines, the **base URL** is

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

In a Remix app, this is initially served from the file at `app/root.tsx`.

However, if we wanted to navigate to a different page - say the 'About Us' page - then we would typically add a new **path** onto the end of the base URL like so:

```bash ins="/about-us" title="URL for the 'About Us' page"
http://localhost:3000/about-us
```

The "route" in this case would then be served from another file in the code base.

In a Remix app, this file would be placed inside the `routes` folder, and called `about-us.tsx`.

<FileTree>

- app
	- root.tsx
	- routes
		- _index.tsx
		- **about-us.tsx**

</FileTree>

The file name - `about-us.tsx` - and the URL path - `/about-us` - must match in order for Remix to serve the correct page.

### Parent and child routes

A "child" route is nested _within_ another route, which we call a "parent".

As soon as we place the `Outlet` component inside a route file (like we just have in `root.tsx`), it converts the file into a "parent" route.

`Outlet` tells Remix where to render the matching child route(s) within the parent.

:::caution[Important!]

Because the parent is already loaded into memory, this makes page loads quicker because Remix only needs to load the new content from the child.

This is really fast! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

:::

#### The main index page of a website

Hover your cursor over the two buttons below to see how the parent `root.tsx` renders its child code through the `<Outlet />` component:

<NestedRouting />

::::

## The route structure

So, how does Remix know which route files to load as "children" of "parents"? ðŸ¤”

The answer lies in Remix's **file names**.

The structure of your project's files and folders directly maps to the structure of your routes in the browser URL bar.

We can see this in action by adding a new route to our app. Let's add a dummy 'about us' page.

### Adding a new route

Create a new file at `app/routes/about-us.tsx`:

![About us page file](src/assets/png/add-new-route.png)

:::danger[Extra care]

### Route file names in Remix

Take extra care when naming your route files in Remix. The file name **must** match the URL path that you want to serve from it ***exactly***.

For example, because we want to serve a page from the URL path `/about-us`, then the file name must also be `about-us.tsx`.

If it was named `aboutUs.tsx` or `about_us.tsx`, then Remix would not be able to serve the correct page from the URL.

:::

Inside this new file, add the following code and save your changes:

```tsx title="app/routes/about-us.tsx"
export default function AboutUsRoute() {
  return (
    <main className="container py-16">
      <h1 className="text-mega">About us</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Head back over to your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/about-us](http://localhost:3000/about-us). You should see the new 'About us' page:

![About us page navigation](src/assets/gif/about-us-page.gif)

Notice how the navbar, footer and theme switcher are still present on the page?

Think of the `Outlet` component as a "window" or "placeholder" for the child route. It's a way of telling Remix where to render the child route's code **inside** the parent.

## Update navbar links

Finally, let's update the navbar links to include the new 'About us' page.

Open `app/components/organisms/HeaderWithSearch.tsx` and add the following code to the navbar section:

```diff title="app/components/organisms/HeaderWithSearch.tsx" lang="tsx" ins=' className="flex flex-1 justify-center gap-8"'
export default function HeaderWithSearch() {
	const matches = useMatches()
	const isOnSearchPage = matches.find(m => m.id === 'routes/users+/index')
	const searchBar = isOnSearchPage ? null : <SearchBar status="idle" />

	return (
		<header className="bg-primary py-6">
			<nav className="container flex flex-wrap items-center justify-between gap-4 sm:flex-nowrap md:gap-8">
				<Link to="/">
					<div className="flex items-center gap-4">
						<img src={logo} alt="Epic News Logo" className="w-16" />
						<span className="text-sm text-foreground">Epic News</span>
					</div>
				</Link>
+
				<div className="flex flex-1 justify-center gap-8">
					<Link
						to="/news"
						className="text-sm font-semibold text-muted-foreground transition hover:text-foreground"
					>
						News
					</Link>
+					<Link
+						to="/about-us"
+						className="text-sm font-semibold text-muted-foreground transition hover:text-foreground"
+					>
+						About us
+					</Link>
				</div>

				<div className="ml-auto hidden max-w-sm flex-1 sm:block">
					{searchBar}
				</div>
				<div className="flex items-center gap-10">
					<LoginOrUserDropdown />
				</div>
				<div className="block w-full sm:hidden">{searchBar}</div>
			</nav>
		</header>
	)
}
```

### Link prefetching

We can further speed up page loading times by adding a special `prefetch` attribute to Remix's `Link` component.

When a user hovers over a link with the `prefetch` attribute, Remix will begin to load the linked page in the background. This means that when the user clicks on the link, the page will load almost instantly.

Add the `prefetch` attribute to the new 'About us' link in the navbar:

```diff title="app/components/organisms/HeaderWithSearch.tsx" lang="tsx"
<Link
	to="/about-us"
+	prefetch="intent"
	className="text-sm font-semibold text-foreground transition hover:text-primary-foreground"
>
	About us
</Link>
```
You can see this behaviour in action if you open devtools in your browser, navigate to the 'Network' tab, and hover over the 'About us' link in the navbar:

![Link prefetching in action](src/assets/gif/link-prefetch-intent.gif)

Notice how the browser begins to load the 'about-us' page in the background as soon as you hover over the link? By the time you click on the link, the page will load almost instantly.

:::tip[Your turn]

### Challenge

Add a new `/contact-us` route to your app. Below are the requirements:

- For the time being, this page should just show a simple title, just like `/about-us`.
- You should also add a link to the new page in your navbar
- Add the `prefetch` attribute to the new navbar link to speed up page loading times.

Visit each page in your browser to check that they are being served correctly:

1. Visiting `http://localhost:3000/contact-us` should show a page with the title "Contact us"
2. Make sure the navbar and footer still show as expected on each page.

## Summary

In this tutorial we have:

- Learned how to use the `Outlet` component to render child routes inside a parent route
- Discovered how to create a new route file in Remix
- Understood how the file naming conventions in Remix map to the URL paths in the browser
- Added new routes to our app and seen how they are served from the correct URL paths

## ðŸ“„ Assignment documentation

We need to update your assignment to document the new features added in this section. ðŸš€

1. Explain what the `Outlet` component is and how it is used in a Remix application.
2. Describe how the file naming conventions in Remix map to the URL paths in the browser.
3. Explain how to add new routes to a Remix application and how they are served from the correct URL paths.
4. Explain why the `Link` component makes navigation between pages faster in a Remix application.
5. What is the `prefetch` attribute and how does it speed up page loading times even more in a Remix application?

## What's next?

In the next lesson, we will learn how to create sibling routes with their own children.

This will allow us to create a more complex route structure that can serve multiple pages from the same level in the app.
