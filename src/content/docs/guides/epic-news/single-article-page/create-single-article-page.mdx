In this guide, you'll learn how to create a single article page in Epic News.

## The single article page

Now that we have a news index page, we need a page for users to read the full article. For now, this page will display the article title, first image, author, date, and content.

## Create the single article page

## Code challenge

Remind yourself how we created a [**dynamic page**](/code-monster/guides/epic-news/routing/dynamic-routes#creating-a-dynamic-route) for the different news categories. If you remember, we made the route dynamic by using the `$categoryId` route param.

In a similar way, we need to create another dynamic route, but this time for single articles. The article will be found by its `id` field.

With this knowledge, can you create a new dynamic route for the single article page?

### Instructions

- The new page should be accessible at the route `/article/$articleId` in the broswer.

- The `articleId` doesn't need to be a real `id` from the database at the moment - remember that route params are dynamic and can be anything.

- For the time being, just display a fake page title and the `articleId` in the page content.

- You should `console.log` the fake `articleId` route param to verify that the dynamic route is working.

After you've had a go at this yourself, check out the solution below.

## Solution

<MonsterReveal title="1. Create a new route file">

### 1. Create a new route file

1. Create a new file in the `src/routes` directory called `article.$articleId.tsx`:

![Single article file](src/assets/webp/epic-news/single-article-file.webp)

</MonsterReveal>

<MonsterReveal title="2. Adding code">

### 2. Adding code

2. To display a fake article and the `articleId` in the page content, add the following code to the `article.$articleId.tsx` file:

```tsx title="app/routes/article.$articleId.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { type LoaderFunctionArgs, json } from '@remix-run/node'
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'

export async function loader({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
	const { articleId } = params

	return json({ articleId })
}

export default function ArticlePage() {
	const { articleId } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

	return (
		<div className="container py-16">
			<h2 className="pb-8 text-h2">My amazing news article</h2>

			<p>Article ID: {articleId}</p>
		</div>
	)
}
```

With this in place, you should see the fake article title and the `articleId` in the page content when you navigate to `/article/$articleId`:

![Single article page](src/assets/webp/epic-news/single-article-page.webp)

</MonsterReveal>

## Summary

In this guide, we have:

- Created a new dynamic page for the single article page.
- Displayed a fake article title and the `articleId` in the page content.
- Verified that the dynamic route is working.

## ðŸ“„ Assignment documentation

We need to update your assignment to document this new feature. ðŸš€

1. In your assignment documentation, add a new section called "Single article page".
2. Describe how you created the single article page.
3. Explain how you accessed the `articleId` route param, and then passed it to the page content via the `useLoaderData` hook.
