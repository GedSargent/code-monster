Another way to sign up for an account is with a single-sign-on (SSO) provider. Using a SSO provider like GitHub is a great way to reduce the number of passwords a user has to remember. A single digital identity can be used to access multiple applications.

In this guide, we'll use GitHub, which is pre-installed in the Epic Stack, but it's possible to add more if you want to.

## What is SSO and OAuth?

Tranditionally, when a user signs up for an account on a website, they create a username and password. This is known as a "local" account.

With SSO, a user can sign up for an account using an existing account with a third-party provider, like GitHub.

OAuth is a protocol that allows a user to grant a third-party application access to their account without sharing their password. When you sign up for an account using GitHub, you are using OAuth to authenticate with GitHub.

## Set up a GitHub OAuth application

To use GitHub as an SSO provider, you need to create an OAuth application in your GitHub account. This will give you a `client_id` and `client_secret` that you can use to authenticate users. Let's go through the steps to set this up.

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Click your profile icon on the top right of your screen and go to `Settings -> Developer settings -> OAuth Apps`.

3. Hit the "**Register a new application**" button.

![Github registerr new app](src/assets/png/epic-news/github-register-new-app.png)

4. Type in `http://localhost:3000` for "Homepage URL" and `http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback` for "Authorization callback URL". As for the Application name set to something meaningful (because your users will see the app's name), e.g. `EPIC_NEWS`.

6. Hit the "Register application" button.
7. You will be redirected to the page with your newly created OAuth app's details. You will see your app has got 0 users and no client secrets just yet, but the Client ID has already been assigned to your app.

8. Copy over the `Client ID` value and paste it as the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` in your `.env` file.

9. Now hit the "Generate client secret" button.

10. Copy over the newly generted secret to `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` in the `.env` file.

10. Hit the `Update application` button at the bottom of your GitHub OAuth app page.

Your final `.env` file should now resemble this (values have been redacted):

```sh title=".env" frame="none" showLineNumbers collapse={1-9} {13, 14}
LITEFS_DIR="/litefs/data"
DATABASE_PATH="./prisma/data.db"
DATABASE_URL="file:./data.db?connection_limit=1"
CACHE_DATABASE_PATH="./other/cache.db"
SESSION_SECRET="super-duper-s3cret"
HONEYPOT_SECRET="super-duper-s3cret"
INTERNAL_COMMAND_TOKEN="some-made-up-token"
RESEND_API_KEY="re_blAh_blaHBlaHblahBLAhBlAh"
SENTRY_DSN="your-dsn"

# the mocks and some code rely on these two being prefixed with "MOCK_"
# if they aren't then the real github api will be attempted
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="72fa***************a"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="b2c6d323b**************************eae016"
GITHUB_TOKEN="MOCK_GITHUB_TOKEN"
```

:::danger[Important]

Before continuing, be sure to **restart your application** to pick up the new environment variables.

You can do this by stopping the server with `Ctrl + C` in your terminal, and then running `npm run dev` again.

## Create a website user account via Github SSO

Make sure you are signed out of any existing user accounts on your Epic News application by clicking the "Logout" button in the top right corner of the screen.

![Sign out](src/assets/png/epic-news/sign-out.png)

Next, in the address bar of your browser, navigate to the `/signup` route.

```bash title="Epic News signup URL"
http://localhost:3000/signup
```

This time, click on the "Signup with GitHub" button.

![Epic News signup screen](src/assets/png/signup-with-github.png)

You'll be told that you don't have any connections yet. Click "**Connect with GitHub**":

![No connections prompt](src/assets/png/epic-news/no-connections-prompt.png)

If you are not already logged in to GitHub, you will be prompted to do so. Once you are logged in, you will be asked fill in your user details.

You will notice that this time, your username and avatar have been pre-filled from your GitHub account. Add your name, accept the Terms of Service, then click "**Create an account**".

Once you have created an account, spend some time exploring the different functionality available to authenticated users.

You can access the features listed below via the user actions dropdown in the top right corner of the screen:

![User actions dropdown](src/assets/png/epic-news/user-actions-dropdown.png)

For example, you can:

- View your profile page.
- Edit your email address and password.
- Manage 'connections' - a feature that allows you to see and edit which SSO providers your account is connected to.
- Download your data. What data is stored in the application about you?.
- See which active sessions are currently logged in to your account. **TIP**: Try logging in to your account from another browser or an incognito session to see this feature in action.
- Create, edit, read and delete 'notes'.
- Delete your account.

## Summary

In this guide, you learned how to set up a GitHub OAuth application and use it to authenticate users in your Epic News application.

You also explored the different features available to authenticated users, such as managing connections, viewing active sessions, and creating, editing, reading, and deleting notes.

In the next guide, you will learn how to add 'toast' notifications to your application.
