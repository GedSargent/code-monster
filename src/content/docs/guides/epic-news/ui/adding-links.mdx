import MonsterReveal from "src/components/MonsterReveal.astro"

Now that we have a site logo in the navigation bar, let's add some links to pages around the site.

## The Remix `Link` component

Traditionally, in a React app, you would use an `a` tag to create a link to another page.

However, in Remix, we use the `Link` component from `@remix-run/react` because it has several advantages:

- It can be set to pre-fetch the linked page's data, so the page loads faster
- The `Link` component loads content without requiring a full page refresh
- It can incorporate "nested routes", where a parent route can load data for a child route (we will cover this in a later tutorial)

## Adding links to the navigation bar

Let's start by adding a `Link` to the logo in the navigation bar. This will link back to the home page of the site.

Firstly, let's `import` the `Link` component from `@remix-run/react`:

```diff lang="tsx" ins="Link, " title="app/components/organisms/HeaderWithSearch.tsx"
import { Link, useMatches } from '@remix-run/react'
import { SearchBar } from '../molecules/SearchBar'
import LoginOrUserDropdown from './LoginOrUserDropdown'
import logo from '~/assets/png/epic-news-logo.png'
```

Next, let's wrap the logo and site title inside this `Link` component:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/components/organisms/HeaderWithSearch.tsx" showLineNumbers collapse={1-4, 20-26}
import { Link, useMatches } from '@remix-run/react'
import { SearchBar } from '../molecules/SearchBar'
import LoginOrUserDropdown from './LoginOrUserDropdown'
import logo from '~/assets/png/epic-news-logo.png'

export default function HeaderWithSearch() {
	const matches = useMatches()
	const isOnSearchPage = matches.find(m => m.id === 'routes/users+/index')
	const searchBar = isOnSearchPage ? null : <SearchBar status="idle" />

	return (
		<header className="dark:bg-dark-primary/10 bg-primary/10 py-6">
			<nav className="container flex flex-wrap items-center justify-between gap-4 sm:flex-nowrap md:gap-8">
+				<Link to="/">
					<div className="flex items-center gap-4">
						<img src={logo} alt="Epic News Logo" className="w-16" />
						<span className="text-sm text-foreground">Epic News</span>
					</div>
+				</Link>
				<div className="ml-auto hidden max-w-sm flex-1 sm:block">
					{searchBar}
				</div>
				<div className="flex items-center gap-10">
					<LoginOrUserDropdown />
				</div>
				<div className="block w-full sm:hidden">{searchBar}</div>
			</nav>
		</header>
	)
}
```

## Adding a link to 'News'

Now that we have a link to the home page, see if you can add a link to the 'News' page. This page doesn't exist yet, but we will create it in a later tutorial.

The link should:
- be placed in the navigation bar, next to the logo
- have the text "News"
- link to the `"news"` route
- be styled however you like, but have a hover effect (e.g. the text colour changes)
- created with the Remix `Link` component

Once you've added it, compare your solution against the one below:

<MonsterReveal>

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/components/organisms/HeaderWithSearch.tsx" showLineNumbers collapse={}
import { Link, useMatches } from '@remix-run/react'
import { SearchBar } from '../molecules/SearchBar'
import LoginOrUserDropdown from './LoginOrUserDropdown'
import logo from '~/assets/png/epic-news-logo.png'

export default function HeaderWithSearch() {
	const matches = useMatches()
	const isOnSearchPage = matches.find(m => m.id === 'routes/users+/index')
	const searchBar = isOnSearchPage ? null : <SearchBar status="idle" />

	return (
		<header className="dark:bg-dark-primary/10 bg-primary/10 py-6">
			<nav className="container flex flex-wrap items-center justify-between gap-4 sm:flex-nowrap md:gap-8">
				<Link to="/">
					<div className="flex items-center gap-4">
						<img src={logo} alt="Epic News Logo" className="w-16" />
						<span className="text-sm text-foreground">Epic News</span>
					</div>
				</Link>
				<div>
+					<Link
+						to="/news"
+						className="text-sm font-semibold text-muted-foreground transition hover:text-foreground"
+					>
+						News
+					</Link>
				</div>
				<div className="ml-auto hidden max-w-sm flex-1 sm:block">
					{searchBar}
				</div>
				<div className="flex items-center gap-10">
					<LoginOrUserDropdown />
				</div>
				<div className="block w-full sm:hidden">{searchBar}</div>
			</nav>
		</header>
	)
}
```

</MonsterReveal>

The code above adds a simple link like so:

![Navbar with News link](src/assets/gif/navbar-news-link.gif)

## Customising the footer

Now that we've added links and a logo to the navigation bar, let's customise the footer.

If you've been following along with the Epic News project, you'll have the `FooterMenuRight` component from the `app/components/organisms/Footer/FooterMenuRight.tsx` file:

![Footer menu right start](src/assets/png/epic-news/footer-menu-right-start.png)

:::tip[Challenge]

You task is to customise the footer by adding the following:

- The site logo, which you have used in the navigation bar
- A link to the home page (this could be the site logo)
- A link to the 'News' page
- Two more links to pages that don't exist yet (e.g. 'About' and 'Contact')
- Style the links however you like, but ensure they have a hover effect and are consistent with the navigation bar
- A custom copyright message

All links must be created with the Remix `Link` component.

Good luck!

## ðŸ“„ Report writing

In this tutorial, we have:

- Learned about the Remix `Link` component
- Added a link to the home page in the navigation bar
- Added a link to the 'News' page in the navigation bar
- Customised the footer with links, a site logo and a copyright message

You will need to document all the changes that you have made to the site so far in this 'User Interface' section.

You should include:

- How you have imported components into the `root.tsx` file.
- Adding a navigation bar using the `<HeaderWithSearch />` component.
- Adding a footer using the `<FooterMenuRight />` component.
- Creating a logo for the site using Figma
- Exporting the logo as a PNG file
- Importing images into the project and using them in components
- Adding the logo to the navigation bar and footer
- Customising the position of the logo in the navigation bar with Tailwind CSS and flexbox
- Adding links to the navigation bar and footer using the Remix `Link` component
- Styling the links with Tailwind CSS and hover effects
- Customising the footer with links, a site logo and a copyright message
