## Introduction

In this guide, we will learn how to use and build custom components for your Epic News site.

The starter project that you have downloaded comes with several custom components that you can use to build your site.

We will start with these as a foundation, and then you can build your own custom components as you need them.

## Pre-built Custom Components

The Epic News starter project comes with several custom components that you can use to build your site.

Let's take a look at some of these components.

### `HeroCallToAction` component

Open `app/root.tsx` and add the following to the end of your `import` list:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/components/organisms/HeaderWithSearch.tsx" collapse={1-6}
import { type LinksFunction } from '@remix-run/node'
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
import Document from '~/components/shared-layout/Document'
import ThemeSwitch from '~/components/shared-layout/ThemeSwitch'
import { useNonce } from '~/utils/nonce-provider.ts'
import rootLinkElements from '~/utils/providers/rootLinkElements'
import { loader } from './__root.server'
import useTheme from './hooks/useTheme.tsx'
import HeaderWithSearch from './components/organisms/HeaderWithSearch'
+import HeroCallToAction from './components/organisms/Hero/HeroCallToAction.tsx'
```

Next, slot this component just below the `h1` tag in the JSX being returned by the `App` component:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/root.tsx" collapse={1-16}
import { type LinksFunction } from '@remix-run/node'
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
import Document from '~/components/shared-layout/Document'
import ThemeSwitch from '~/components/shared-layout/ThemeSwitch'
import { useNonce } from '~/utils/nonce-provider.ts'
import rootLinkElements from '~/utils/providers/rootLinkElements'
import { loader } from './__root.server'
import useTheme from './hooks/useTheme.tsx'
import HeaderWithSearch from './components/organisms/HeaderWithSearch'
import HeroCallToAction from './components/organisms/Hero/HeroCallToAction.tsx'

export const links: LinksFunction = () => {
  return rootLinkElements
}
export { headers, meta } from './__root.client.tsx'
export { action, loader } from './__root.server.tsx'

export default function App() {
  const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
  const nonce = useNonce()
  const theme = useTheme()

  return (
    <Document nonce={nonce} theme={theme}>
      <div className="flex h-screen flex-col justify-between">
        <HeaderWithSearch />

        <div className="flex-1">
          <main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
            <h1 className="text-mega">Welcome to Epic News!</h1>
+						<div className="w-full py-16">
+							<HeroCallToAction />
+						</div>
          </main>
        </div>

        <div className="container flex justify-between pb-5">
          <ThemeSwitch userPreference={data.requestInfo.userPrefs.theme} />
        </div>
      </div>
    </Document>
  )
}
```

You will notice that the `HeroCallToAction` component is underlined in red. Let's find out why by hovering our mouse over it:

![Hero Call To Action Missing Props](src/assets/webp/epic-news/hero-call-to-action-missing-props.webp)

The error message is telling us that the component is expecting two props to be passed to it: `image` and `children`.

Let's add these now:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/root.tsx" collapse={}
export default function App() {
  const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
  const nonce = useNonce()
  const theme = useTheme()

  return (
    <Document nonce={nonce} theme={theme}>
      <div className="flex h-screen flex-col justify-between">
        <HeaderWithSearch />

        <div className="flex-1">
          <main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
            <h1 className="text-mega">Welcome to Epic News!</h1>
							<div className="w-full py-16">
-								<HeroCallToAction />
+								<HeroCallToAction image="https://www.helpguide.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Social-Media-and-Mental-Health.webp">
+									<div className="flex flex-col gap-8 px-8">
+										<h2 className="text-h2">Welcome to Epic News</h2>
+										<p className="text-lg">
+											Keep up to date with the latest tech news.
+										</p>
+									</div>
+								</HeroCallToAction>
							</div>
          </main>
        </div>

        <div className="container flex justify-between pb-5">
          <ThemeSwitch userPreference={data.requestInfo.userPrefs.theme} />
        </div>
      </div>
    </Document>
  )
}
```

Save the changes to your file and head back to your browser.

You should now see the `HeroCallToAction` component displayed correctly on your site:

![Hero Call To Action](src/assets/webp/epic-news/hero-call-to-action-with-components.webp)

## Exploring components

If you look inside the `HeroCallToAction` component code, you will see that it has an `interface` defined at the top of the file. This interface defines the props that the component expects to receive.

Let's take a look at it:

```tsx title="app/components/organisms/Hero/HeroCallToAction.tsx"
interface HeroCallToActionProps {
	image: string
	imageRight?: boolean
	hasBackgroundColour?: boolean
	children: React.ReactNode
}
```

This tells us that the component has two optional props as well.

The `imageRight` prop is a boolean that determines whether the image should be displayed on the right or left side of the component.

The `hasBackgroundColour` prop is a boolean that determines whether the component should have a background colour.

Let's try adding an `imageRight` prop to the component where we call it in `app/root.tsx`:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/root.tsx" collapse={}

<HeroCallToAction
	image="https://www.helpguide.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Social-Media-and-Mental-Health.webp"
+	imageRight={true}
>
	<div className="flex flex-col gap-8 px-8">
		<h2 className="text-h2">Welcome to Epic News</h2>
		<p className="text-lg">
			Keep up to date with the latest tech news.
		</p>
	</div>
</HeroCallToAction>

```

With this change saved, check your browser again:

![Hero Call To Action Image Right](src/assets/webp/epic-news/hero-call-to-action-image-right.webp)

Exploring the custom components in the Epic News starter project will help you understand how they work and how you can build your own custom components.

Looking at the `interface` expected by a component will help you understand what props you need to pass to it.

:::tip[Challenge]

## Challenges

1. Provide an image to the `HeroCallToAction` component that is taken from the `app/assets/jpg` folder instead of the external image we currently have.
2. Customise the `children` of the `HeroCallToAction` component to display your own custom message with styles.
3. You will notice that the `HeroCallToAction` component has a `hasBackgroundColour` prop, but this is not used anywhere inside the component.

		- Fix the component so that if `hasBackgroundColour` is set to true, it should have the background colour class of `bg-secondary`. If it is false, is should be `bg-transparent`
		- TIP: Look at how similar logic has been implemented from lines 15-19 with the `imageRight` prop.

## Experiementation

There are lots of custom components in the `app/components` directory that you can explore and use in your site.

Documentation for each can be found in the `README_COMPONENTS.md` at the root of your project.

Try experimenting with these components to see how they work and how you can use them in your site.
