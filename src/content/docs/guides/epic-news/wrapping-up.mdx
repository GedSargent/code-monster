## Project complete

Congratulations! You have completed the Epic News project. You have built a full-stack application with Remix, Prisma, TailwindCSS and React.

You have learned how to:

- Create a full-stack application with Remix
- Use Prisma to interact with a SQLite database
- Use TailwindCSS to style your application
- Use React to build components
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Protect routes based on user roles
- Publish and unpublish articles
- Display only published articles to end users

## ðŸš€ Extra credits

If you want to continue working on this project, here are some ideas for extra features you could implement:

- Complete the 'About Us' and 'Contact Us' pages
- Add 'Publish/Unpublish' buttons to single articles for logged in admin users only
- Customise the design of the 404 page so that it is more 'on brand' for your own website
- Add a confirmation dialogue box to double-check the admin user really wants to publish an article
- Allow admin users to edit all articles on the single article page (i.e. on a new `article.$articleId.edit.tsx` route)
- Allow normal users to edit their ***own*** articles (but not anyone else's) on the single article page (i.e. on a new `article.$articleId.edit.tsx` route)
- The 'search' field in the navbar currently only searches for users registered on the site. Modify this so that it searches for articles by their title.
