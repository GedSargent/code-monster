In this guide, we will add an `imageUrl` field to our `Game` model. This will allow us to store the URL of an image for each game.

## Understanding Database Schema Changes

When building applications, it's common to need to update your database schema as your application evolves. Prisma makes this process straightforward with its migration system.

## Step 1: Update the Prisma Schema

First, we need to modify our Prisma schema to include the new `imageUrl` field in the `Game` model.

```diff lang="prisma" title="prisma/schema.prisma"
model Game {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  title       String
  description String
  price       Float
  rating      Float
  releaseDate DateTime
+  imageUrl    String?

  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
```

:::note
We've added an `imageUrl` field of type `String` with a question mark (`?`), which makes it optional. This means games can exist in our database without an image URL.
:::

## Step 2: Create a Migration

After updating the schema, we need to create a migration to apply this change to our database. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_image_url_to_game_model
```

This command will:
1. Generate a new migration file
2. Apply the migration to your development database
3. Generate an updated Prisma client

The migration file will look something like this:

```sql lang="sql" title="prisma/migrations/20250506213524_add_image_to_game_model/migration.sql"
-- AlterTable
ALTER TABLE "Game" ADD COLUMN "imageUrl" TEXT;
```

:::note
Prisma automatically generates the SQL needed to update your database schema. In this case, it's adding a new TEXT column called "imageUrl" to the Game table.
:::

## Step 3: Source images from the Internet

Before we can add actual image URLs to our seed data, we need to find some images to use.

Open your seed file at `prisma/seed.ts`.

Look carefully at the game titles in the seed data.

You will need to find images for each game title. Use a simple Google search to find an image for each game title, and save these to your computer's Downloads folder.

## Step 4: Upload Images to Cloudinary

Next, you will need to create an account with [**Cloudinary**](https://cloudinary.com/).

:::note[What is Cloudinary?]
Cloudinary is a cloud-based image hosting service that we will use to store our game images.

If you already have an account with Cloudinary, you can skip this step.
:::

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the [**Cloudinary sign-up page**](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free) and sign up for a free account.
2. Once you have created an account, you will be presented the question below. Select the option shown below:
  ![Cloudinary signup 1](src/assets/webp/prisma/cloudinary-sign-up.webp)
2. Navigate to **AssetsMedia Library**.
  ![Cloudinary media library](src/assets/webp/prisma/cloudinary-media-library.webp)
3. Click the **Upload** button and select the images you want to upload.
4. Once the images have uploaded, click on each one to view its details.
5. Copy the **URL** for each image, as we will need these in the next step:
  ![Cloudinary image URL](src/assets/webp/prisma/cloudinary-image-url.webp)
</Steps>


## Step 4: Update the Seed Data

Now that we have the new field in our database, we should update our seed data to include image URLs for our games.

```diff lang="tsx" title="prisma/seed.ts"
async function seed() {
  const games = [
    {
      title: "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild",
      description: "...",
      price: 59.99,
      rating: 4.9,
      releaseDate: new Date("2017-03-03"),
+      imageUrl:
+        "https://res.cloudinary.com/abcdefgh/image/upload/v1234567890/gamelog/zelda_osdu8u.webp",
    },
    {
      title: "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt",
      description: "...",
      price: 39.99,
      rating: 4.8,
      releaseDate: new Date("2015-05-19"),
+      imageUrl:
+        "https://res.cloudinary.com/abcdefgh/image/upload/v1234567890/gamelog/witcher-3_tueizl.webp",
    },
    // Additional games with image URLs...
```

:::note
We're adding image URLs for each game in our seed data. These URLs point to images stored in Cloudinary, a cloud-based image hosting service.

Remember that your URLs will be different to the ones shown here. You will need to copy these from your Cloudinary account:

![Cloudinary image URL](src/assets/webp/prisma/copy-image-url.webp)

Once you have a URL for each image, paste it into your seed file in the way shown above and save it.
:::

:::tip[Challenge]

Can you update the seed data to include image URLs for all of the games?

:::

## Step 5: Apply the Updated Seed Data

Now that we have updated the seed data, we need to apply these changes to our database. Run the following command:

```bash
npm run setup
```

After hitting enter, you will be asked to confirm if you want to delete all data in the database. Click 'y' to confirm.

This will delete all data in the database and re-run the seed file.

It will update your database with the new image URLs for each game.

You can check the database to confirm the changes have been applied by running the following command:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

You should see the new `imageUrl` field in the `Game` table, with a URL for each game.

## What We've Learned

In this tutorial, we've:

1. Updated our Prisma schema to include a new field for storing image URLs
2. Created and applied a database migration to update our database schema
3. Updated our seed data to include image URLs for our games
4. Applied the updated seed data to our database

These changes prepare our application to display images for each game, which will make our UI more visually appealing and informative.

## Next Steps

Now that we have image URLs stored in our database, we can update our `GameCard` component to display these images instead of using placeholder images. This will be covered in the next guide.

<MonsterReveal>
  Great job! You've successfully updated your database schema and seed data to include images for your games.
  
  This is a common task in web development, and Prisma makes it easy with its migration system.
  
  In the next guide, we'll use these image URLs to display actual game images in our UI.
