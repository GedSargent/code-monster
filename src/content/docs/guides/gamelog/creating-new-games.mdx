description: Build a form to add new games with image upload functionality
---

import MonsterReveal from 'src/components/MonsterReveal.astro'
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

In this guide, we'll create a form that allows users to add new games to our database. We'll also implement image upload functionality using Cloudinary, a cloud-based image management service.

## Understanding the Challenge

To create a complete game entry, we need to:

<Steps>
1. Build a form to collect game details
2. Create an image uploader component
3. Set up a server endpoint to handle image uploads
4. Connect to Cloudinary for image storage
5. Save all the data to our database
</Steps>

Let's break this down into manageable steps.

## Start the development server

If you need to, start the development server by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Install Cloudinary

Before we can upload images to Cloudinary, we need to install the Cloudinary package. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install cloudinary
```

:::note[What does this package do?]
Cloudinary is a cloud-based image hosting service.

We have already used Cloudinary to host our game images in the previous guide, but we have not yet integrated it with our application.

The `cloudinary` package will allow us to upload images to Cloudinary from our application.
:::

## Create a Cloudinary account

If you have not already done so, sign up for a free Cloudinary account at [**cloudinary.com**](https://cloudinary.com/).

You should then see the Cloudinary dashboard.


## Locate and add Cloudinary credentials

Sign into your Cloudinary account.

:::note[Cloudinary signup]
You should have already signed up to Cloudinary for a free account in a [previous guide](/code-monster/guides/gamelog/adding-an-image-to-the-game-model#step-4-upload-images-to-cloudinary). If you have not done so, please do so now.
:::

Look carefully for a button that says 'View API Keys'. It should look like the one below:

![Cloudinary dashboard](src/assets/webp/prisma/cloudinary-dashboard.webp)

Once you click this, you will have access to your Cloudinary credentials.

To upload images to Cloudinary, we need to store these credentials in **environment variables**.


Open the `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables beneath the one already there:

```diff lang="bash" title=".env"
DATABASE_URL="file:./data.db?connection_limit=1"

+CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
+CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
+CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

Replace `your_cloud_name`, `your_api_key`, and `your_api_secret` with the values from your Cloudinary account shown below:

![Cloudinary credentials](src/assets/webp/prisma/cloudinary-credentials.webp)

With these in place, we are now ready to create our image uploader.

## Step 1: Create an Image Uploader Component

First, we'll create a reusable component for uploading images. This component will:
- Allow users to select an image file
- Show a preview of the selected image
- Upload the image to Cloudinary
- Return the URL of the uploaded image

Add a new file at `app/components/ImageUploader.tsx` and add the following code:

```tsx lang="tsx" title="app/components/ImageUploader.tsx"
import { useState, useRef } from "react";
import { useFetcher } from "@remix-run/react";

// Define the response type from the upload API
interface UploadResponse {
  imageUrl?: string;
  error?: string;
}

interface ImageUploaderProps {
  onImageUploaded: (imageUrl: string) => void;
}

export default function ImageUploader({ onImageUploaded }: ImageUploaderProps) {
  const [preview, setPreview] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false);
  const fileInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
  const fetcher = useFetcher<UploadResponse>();

  const handleFileChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const file = e.target.files?.[0];
    if (!file) return;

    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onloadend = () => {
      setPreview(reader.result as string);
    };
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
  };

  const handleUpload = async () => {
    if (!preview) return;

    setIsUploading(true);
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append("image", preview);

    fetcher.submit(formData, {
      method: "post",
      action: "/api/upload",
      encType: "multipart/form-data",
    });
  };

  // Handle the response from the upload
  if (fetcher.data?.imageUrl && isUploading) {
    setIsUploading(false);
    onImageUploaded(fetcher.data.imageUrl);
  }

  // Handle errors
  if (fetcher.state === "idle" && isUploading && fetcher.data?.error) {
    setIsUploading(false);
  }

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-1">
      <label
        htmlFor="image"
        className="block text-sm font-medium mb-2 text-slate-400"
      >
        Image
      </label>
      <div className="relative h-72 overflow-hidden bg-gray-800 rounded-xl">
        {preview ? (
          <img
            src={preview}
            alt="Preview"
            className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover"
          />
        ) : (
          <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-full">
            <p className="text-gray-400">No image selected</p>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>

      <div className="flex gap-4 mt-4 justify-end">
        <input
          type="file"
          accept="image/*"
          onChange={handleFileChange}
          ref={fileInputRef}
          className="hidden"
        />

        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={() => fileInputRef.current?.click()}
          className="bg-gray-700 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-md transition hover:bg-gray-800"
        >
          Select Image
        </button>

        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={handleUpload}
          disabled={!preview || isUploading}
          className={`px-4 py-2 rounded-md ${
            !preview || isUploading
              ? "bg-gray-600 text-gray-400 transition hover:bg-gray-600 disabled:hover:bg-gray-600 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
              : "bg-cyan-600 text-white"
          }`}
        >
          {isUploading ? "Uploading..." : "Upload"}
        </button>
      </div>

      {fetcher.data?.error && (
        <p className="text-red-500">{fetcher.data.error}</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

:::note
This component uses several important React and Remix concepts:

<Steps>
1. **useState**: Manages the component's state for the image preview and upload status
2. **useRef**: Creates a reference to the file input element so we can trigger it programmatically
3. **useFetcher**: A Remix hook that allows us to make API calls without navigating to a new page
4. **FormData**: A browser API for creating form data to send to the server
5. **FileReader**: A browser API for reading files as data URLs
</Steps>
:::

## Step 2: Create a Cloudinary Integration

Next, we'll create a server-side utility to handle the Cloudinary integration. This will securely upload our images to Cloudinary and return the URL.

Create a new file at `app/utils/cloudinary.server.ts` and add the following code:

```tsx lang="tsx" title="app/utils/cloudinary.server.ts"
import { v2 as cloudinary } from "cloudinary";

cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});

export async function uploadImage(imageData: string) {
  try {
    const result = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(imageData, {
      folder: "game-covers",
    });
    return result.secure_url;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Cloudinary upload error:", error);
    throw new Error("Failed to upload image");
  }
}
```

:::note
This server-side utility:

1. Configures the Cloudinary SDK with our account credentials from environment variables
2. Provides an `uploadImage` function that:
   - Takes a base64-encoded image string
   - Uploads it to Cloudinary in a "game-covers" folder
   - Returns the secure URL of the uploaded image
   - Handles errors appropriately

The `.server` in the filename is a Remix convention that ensures this code only runs on the server, keeping our API credentials secure.
:::

## Step 3: Create an API Route for Image Uploads

Now, we'll create an API route that our ImageUploader component can call to upload images.

Create a new file at `app/routes/api.upload.tsx` and add the following code:

```tsx lang="tsx" title="app/routes/api.upload.tsx"
import { json } from "@remix-run/node";
import type { ActionFunctionArgs } from "@remix-run/node";
import { uploadImage } from "~/utils/cloudinary.server";

export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  if (request.method !== "POST") {
    return json({ error: "Method not allowed" }, { status: 405 });
  }

  try {
    const formData = await request.formData();
    const imageData = formData.get("image") as string;

    if (!imageData) {
      return json({ error: "No image provided" }, { status: 400 });
    }

    const imageUrl = await uploadImage(imageData);
    return json({ imageUrl });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Upload error:", error);
    return json({ error: "Failed to upload image" }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

:::note
### What is an API route?

An API route is a special type of route in Remix that is designed to handle API requests.

API routes are typically used to handle requests that don't render a page in the browser, such as requests to upload files, send emails, or fetch data from external APIs.

This API route uses Remix's **action function** to handle POST requests:

<Steps>
1. It first checks if the request method is POST
2. Then it extracts the form data from the request using `request.formData()`
3. It gets the image data from the form data
4. It calls our `uploadImage` utility to upload the image to Cloudinary
5. Finally, it returns the image URL as JSON, or an error if something went wrong
</Steps>

The filename `api.upload.tsx` creates a route at `/api/upload` in Remix's file-based routing system.
:::

## Step 4: Create the Add Game Form

Finally, we'll create the main form for adding new games, which will use our ImageUploader component.

```tsx lang="tsx" title="app/routes/add-game.tsx"
import { useState } from "react";
import { Form, Link, useLoaderData } from "@remix-run/react";
import { json, redirect } from "@remix-run/node";
import type { ActionFunctionArgs } from "@remix-run/node";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import ImageUploader from "~/components/ImageUploader";

export async function loader() {
  const prisma = new PrismaClient();
  const categories = await prisma.category.findMany({
    select: { id: true, title: true },
    orderBy: { title: "asc" },
  });

  prisma.$disconnect();

  return json({ categories });
}

export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const title = formData.get("title") as string;
  const description = formData.get("description") as string;
  const price = parseFloat(formData.get("price") as string);
  const rating = parseFloat(formData.get("rating") as string);
  const releaseDate = new Date(formData.get("releaseDate") as string);
  const imageUrl = formData.get("imageUrl") as string;
  const categoryId = formData.get("categoryId") as string;

  const prisma = new PrismaClient();

  await prisma.game.create({
    data: {
      title,
      description,
      price,
      rating,
      releaseDate,
      imageUrl,
      categoryId,
    },
  });

  prisma.$disconnect();

  return redirect("/");
}

export default function AddGame() {
  const { categories } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();
  const [imageUrl, setImageUrl] = useState("");

  const handleImageUploaded = (url: string) => {
    setImageUrl(url);
  };

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-20 px-4">
      <h1 className="font-bold text-5xl text-center mb-10">
        Add <span className="text-cyan-400">Game</span>
      </h1>

      <div className="max-w-2xl mx-auto bg-gray-950 p-8 rounded-xl">
        <Form method="post" className="space-y-6">
          <input type="hidden" name="imageUrl" value={imageUrl} />

          <div>
            <label
              htmlFor="title"

            <input

              id="title"
              name="title"

              className="w-full p-3 bg-gray-800 rounded-md focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-cyan-500"

:::note
This page combines several important Remix concepts:

1. **Loader Function**: Fetches the categories from the database before the page renders
2. **Action Function**: Processes the form submission and creates a new game in the database
3. **Form Component**: Remix's `<Form>` component that handles form submissions
4. **useLoaderData Hook**: Accesses the data returned by the loader function
5. **useState Hook**: Manages the image URL state
6. **redirect Function**: Redirects the user to the home page after successful form submission

The form includes fields for all the game properties, including a hidden field for the image URL that gets populated when an image is uploaded.
:::

## Understanding Key Concepts

### Remix Action Functions

In Remix, an action function handles form submissions and other non-GET requests. It runs on the server and receives the request object, which contains the form data. The action function can:

<Steps>
1. Process the form data
2. Interact with the database
3. Return a response, such as redirecting to another page
</Steps>

Action functions are defined in route files and are automatically called when a form is submitted to that route.

### The FormData Object

The `FormData` object is a browser API that represents form data. In Remix:

<Steps>
1. When a form is submitted, Remix automatically creates a FormData object
2. In the action function, we can access this data using `request.formData()`
3. We can extract values using `formData.get("fieldName")`
4. We need to cast these values to the appropriate types (string, number, etc.)
</Steps>

FormData is also useful for programmatically creating form submissions, as we do in the ImageUploader component.

### Cloudinary Integration

Our Cloudinary integration consists of three parts:

1. **Server-side utility** (`cloudinary.server.ts`):
   - Configures the Cloudinary SDK with our account credentials
   - Provides a function to upload images to Cloudinary
   - Returns the URL of the uploaded image

2. **API route** (`api.upload.tsx`):
   - Receives the image data from the client
   - Calls the server-side utility to upload the image
   - Returns the image URL to the client

3. **Client-side component** (`ImageUploader.tsx`):
   - Allows the user to select an image
   - Sends the image data to the API route
   - Receives the image URL and passes it to the parent component

This separation of concerns keeps our code organized and secure, with sensitive operations happening on the server.

## What We've Learned

In this tutorial, we've:

<Steps>
1. Created a reusable image uploader component
2. Set up a Cloudinary integration for storing images
3. Created an API route for handling image uploads
4. Built a form for adding new games to our database
5. Learned about Remix action functions and form handling
</Steps>

These concepts form the foundation for creating interactive web applications with Remix and Prisma.

<MonsterReveal>
  Congratulations! You've built a complete form with image upload functionality. This is a significant achievement that combines many important web development concepts. You can now add new games to your database with images, making your application more dynamic and user-friendly.
