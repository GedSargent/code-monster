In this guide, we'll add functionality that allows users to delete games from the database. This is an essential feature for any CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.

## Understanding the Challenge

To implement delete functionality, we need to:

<Steps>
1. Update the `GameCard` component to include a delete button
2. Create a route that handles the delete action
3. Connect the button to the route using a form
4. Implement the server-side logic to delete the game from the database
</Steps>

Let's break this down into manageable steps.

## Step 1: Update the GameCard Component

First, we need to modify our `GameCard` component to accept a game ID and include a delete button that submits to our delete route.

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/components/GameCard.tsx"
+import { Form } from "@remix-run/react";

interface GameCardProps {
+  id: string;
  title: string;
  releaseDate: string;
  genre: string;
  imageUrl: string;
}
export default function GameCard({
+  id,
  title,
  releaseDate,
  genre,
  imageUrl,
}: GameCardProps) {
  const formattedDate = releaseDate.substring(0, 10);

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <div className="relative h-72 overflow-hidden">
        <img
          src={imageUrl}
          alt={`${title} cover`}
          className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover rounded-xl"
        />
      </div>
      <div className="flex justify-between">
        <div className="flex flex-col justify-between w-2/3">
          <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl text-slate-300">{title}</h3>
          <p className="text-cyan-300 uppercase text-sm font-semibold">
            {genre}
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-200/60 text-sm font-semibold">
            {formattedDate}
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-7 w-1/3">
          <button className="border-2 border-cyan-300 text-cyan-300 p-2 rounded-md transition hover:bg-cyan-50/10">
            View
          </button>
-          <button className="border-2 border-red-300 text-red-300 p-2 rounded-md transition hover:bg-red-50/10">
-            Delete
-          </button>
+          <Form action={`/delete-game/${id}`} method="post">
+            <button
+              type="submit"
+              className="border-2 border-red-300 text-red-300 p-2 rounded-md transition hover:bg-red-50/10 w-full"
+            >
+              Delete
+            </button>
+          </Form>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

:::note
We've made several important changes to the `GameCard` component:

<Steps>
1. **Imported the Form component**: We're using Remix's `Form` component to handle the delete action.
2. **Added an id prop**: We need the game's ID to know which game to delete.
3. **Replaced the button with a Form**: Instead of a simple button, we now have a form that submits to a specific route.
4. **Set the action and method**: The form submits to `/delete-game/${id}` with a POST method (this route doesn't exist yet!)
</Steps>

The `Form` component is a key part of Remix's data mutation strategy. It enhances the HTML `<form>` element with JavaScript-powered submissions while maintaining the browser's native form behavior as a fallback.
:::

## Step 2: Pass the Game ID to the GameCard Component

Now that our `GameCard` component accepts an ID prop, we need to pass the game ID from the parent component.

Open your `app/routes/_index.tsx` file and update the `GameCard` component as follows:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
export default function Index() {
  const { games } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto px-8 grid grid-cols-3 gap-8">
      {games.map((game) => (
        <div key={game.id}>
          <GameCard
            key={game.id}
+            id={game.id}
            title={game.title}
            releaseDate={game.releaseDate}
            imageUrl={game.imageUrl || fallbackImage}
            genre={game.category?.title || "Unknown"}
          />
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

:::note
This is a simple change - we're just passing the `game.id` as a prop to the `GameCard` component. This ID will be used to construct the form action URL.
:::

## Step 3: Create a Route to Handle Game Deletion

Now we need to create a route that will handle the delete action. In Remix, we can create a route with a dynamic parameter using the `$` symbol in the filename.

Create a new file inside `app/routes/` called `delete-game.$gameId.tsx` and add the following code:

```tsx lang="tsx" title="app/routes/delete-game.$gameId.tsx"
import { redirect } from "@remix-run/node";
import type { ActionFunctionArgs } from "@remix-run/node";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

export async function action({ params }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const gameId = params.gameId;

  const prisma = new PrismaClient();

  // Delete the game from the database
  await prisma.game.delete({
    where: { id: gameId },
  });

  prisma.$disconnect();

  // Redirect back to the home page
  return redirect("/");
}

// No need for a default export since this route only handles the action
```

:::note
This route file contains only an action function, with no `default export` for rendering a component. This is because it's a "resource route" that only handles data mutations, not UI rendering.

Key points about this route:

<Steps>
1. **Dynamic Parameter**: The `$gameId` in the filename becomes a parameter in the `params` object.
2. **Action Function**: This function runs when a form is submitted to this route with a POST request.
3. **Prisma Delete Operation**: We use Prisma's `delete` method to remove the game from the database.
4. **Redirect**: After deletion, we redirect the user back to the home page.
</Steps>

The route naming convention (`delete-game.$gameId.tsx`) is part of Remix's file-based routing system. The `$gameId` segment becomes a dynamic parameter that can be accessed via `params.gameId`.

## Understanding Key Concepts

### Remix Resource Routes

A resource route in Remix is a route that doesn't render a UI component but instead handles data operations. These routes typically:

- Have an action function, a loader function, or both
- Don't have a default export (component)
- Are used for API-like functionality within your Remix application

Resource routes are perfect for operations like deleting data, as they provide a clean separation between data mutations and UI rendering.

### Dynamic Route Parameters

Remix uses file naming conventions to define routes with dynamic parameters:

- A file named `delete-game.$gameId.tsx` creates a route that matches `/delete-game/123`, `/delete-game/abc`, etc.
- The `$gameId` part becomes a parameter that can be accessed via `params.gameId` in the loader or action function
- This allows you to create flexible routes that can handle different resources based on the URL

### Form Submissions in Remix

Remix enhances HTML forms with [progressive enhancement](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/progressive-enhancement):

- When JavaScript is available, Remix intercepts the form submission and handles it with client-side navigation
- When JavaScript is not available, the form falls back to the browser's native form submission behavior
- In both cases, the action function in the target route is called to handle the submission

This approach provides a robust user experience that works even if JavaScript fails to load or execute.

## What We've Learned

In this tutorial, we've:

1. Updated the `GameCard` component to include a delete button
2. Created a resource route to handle the delete action
3. Connected the button to the route using Remix's `Form` component
4. Implemented the server-side logic to delete the game from the database

These changes allow users to delete games from the database with a simple button click, completing the "D" in CRUD functionality for our application.

<MonsterReveal>
  Great job! You've successfully implemented delete functionality in your application. This is an essential feature for any data-driven application, allowing users to manage their content effectively. With this addition, your GameLog application now supports both creating and deleting games, making it more useful and complete.
