It would be great if we could also display the category of each game on the page, but category information is stored in a separate table.

Let's see how we can fetch data from two tables in a single request.

## Start the development server

If you need to, start the development server by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Understanding Prisma Relations

In our database, we have a relationship between the `Game` and `Category` tables. Each game belongs to a category, and this relationship is defined in our Prisma schema. We can use Prisma's query capabilities to fetch data from both tables in a single query.

## Step 1: Update the Prisma Query to Include Category Data

First, we need to modify our Prisma query in the loader function to include the category information for each game.

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
export async function loader() {
  const prisma = new PrismaClient();

-  const games = await prisma.game.findMany();
+  const games = await prisma.game.findMany({
+    select: {
+      id: true,
+      title: true,
+      releaseDate: true,
+      category: {
+        select: {
+          title: true,
+        },
+      },
+    },
+  });

  return json({ games });
}
```

:::note
Prisma's `select` option allows us to specify exactly which fields we want to include in our query results. Here, we're selecting the `id`, `title`, and `releaseDate` fields from the `Game` table, as well as the `title` field from the related `Category` table.

This is more efficient than fetching all fields, as it only retrieves the data we need.
:::

## Step 2: Update the GameCard Component Props Interface

Now that we're fetching the category information, we need to update our `GameCard` component to accept and display this data.

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/components/GameCard.tsx"
interface GameCardProps {
  title: string;
  releaseDate: string;
+  genre: string;
}
-export default function GameCard({ title, releaseDate }: GameCardProps) {
+export default function GameCard({ title, releaseDate, genre }: GameCardProps) {
  const formattedDate = releaseDate.substring(0, 10);

  return (
```

:::note
We've added a new `genre` prop to our `GameCardProps` interface and updated the function parameters to include this new prop.
:::

## Step 3: Display the Category Title in the GameCard Component

Next, we need to update the JSX in our `GameCard` component to display the category title.

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/components/GameCard.tsx"
      <div className="flex justify-between">
        <div className="flex flex-col justify-between w-2/3">
          <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl text-slate-300">{title}</h3>
-          <p className="text-cyan-300 uppercase text-sm font-semibold">Genre</p>
+          <p className="text-cyan-300 uppercase text-sm font-semibold">
+            {genre}
+          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-200/60 text-sm font-semibold">
            {formattedDate}
          </p>
        </div>
```

:::note
We're replacing the hardcoded "Genre" text with the dynamic `genre` value that we're receiving as a prop.
:::

## Step 4: Pass the Category Title to the GameCard Component

Finally, we need to update our index route to pass the category title to the `GameCard` component.

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
      {games.map((game) => (
        <div key={game.id}>
          <GameCard
            key={game.id}
            title={game.title}
            releaseDate={game.releaseDate}
+            genre={game.category?.title || "Unknown"}
          />
        </div>
      ))}
```

:::note
We're using the optional chaining operator (`?.`) to safely access the category title. If a game doesn't have a category, this would return `undefined`, and we're providing a fallback value of "Unknown" using the logical OR operator (`||`).
:::

## What We've Learned

In this tutorial, we've:

1. Updated our Prisma query to fetch data from related tables using the `select` option
2. Added a new prop to our `GameCard` component to accept the category title
3. Updated the component to display the dynamic category title
4. Used optional chaining and fallback values to handle cases where a game might not have a category

This approach allows us to efficiently fetch and display data from multiple related tables in our database, providing a more complete and informative user interface.

<MonsterReveal>
  Great job! You've learned how to work with related data in Prisma. This is a powerful feature that allows you to efficiently fetch data from multiple tables in a single query, reducing the number of database requests and improving your application's performance.
