Congratulations on completing the GameLog guides! You've learned a lot about Prisma, Remix, TailwindCSS, and building web applications.

Now it's time to put extend knowledge further. Here are some ideas to get you started:

## Next Steps

<Steps>
1. Implement the 'hero' section of your landing page in `app/routes/_index.tsx`. You could use a custom component, or a component from a UI library such as [**Shadcn/ui**](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
1. Add validation to the `AddGame` form fields. For example, you could check that the game title is not empty, or that the price is a positive number. What other validation checks could you add?
2. Implement error handling for failed image uploads
3. Create a separate page for [editing existing games](/code-monster/guides/gamelog/editing-games)
4. Remove the need to upload a game image manually before submitting the form
5. Add support for multiple images per game
8. Design and build a `ViewGame` page to display a single game's details
6. Add support for [deleting games](/code-monster/guides/gamelog/deleting-games)
7. Add support for updating and deleting images
9. **üöÄ Advanced**: Add support for user accounts and authentication
10. **üöÄ Advanced**: Add support for user reviews and ratings
</Steps>
