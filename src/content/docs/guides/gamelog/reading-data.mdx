title: Reading data - loader functions
description: Reading data from a database using Prisma and Remix
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import MonsterKbd from 'src/components/MonsterKbd.astro'

We are now ready to read data from the database using Prisma and Remix.

Let's get started!

## Start the development server

Start the development server by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see the landing page of our application:

![Hello Gamelogger](src/assets/webp/prisma/hello-gamelogger.webp)

## Finding our code

How can we work out where this page is coming from?

The easiest way is to simply copy the 'Hello Gamelogger' text and search for it in the codebase. Let's do that now.

<Steps>

1. Copy the text 'Hello Gamelogger' from your browser window.

2. In VS Code, press <MonsterKbd>CTRL + Shift + F</MonsterKbd> to open the project search bar, or click the magnifying glass icon at the top left of your screen.

	Paste the text you copied into the search bar.

3. Press `Enter` to search for the text.

4. Should see an exerpt of code from the `app/routes/index.tsx` file.

	Click on the file name to open the code in your editor.

	![Project Search](src/assets/webp/prisma/project-search.webp)

</Steps>

:::tip[Challenge]

Can you update the text in the `index.tsx` file to say 'Hello, world!' instead of 'Hello Gamelogger'?

Once you have, save the file and refresh the page in your browser to see the changes.

This is how we can change the page content in Remix.

Let's now move on to reading data from the database.

## Fetch data from the database

We now need to fetch the games from the database and display them on the page.

We will do this by adding a Remix [**loader function**](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/loader) to the `_index.tsx` file:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/_index.tsx" showLineNumbers collapse={6-11}
+import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
+import { json } from '@remix-run/node'
+import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
import type { MetaFunction } from "@remix-run/node";

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => {
  return [
    { title: "New Remix App" },
    { name: "description", content: "Welcome to Remix!" },
  ];
};

+export async function loader() {
+	const prisma = new PrismaClient()
+
+	const games = await prisma.game.findMany()
+
+	return json({ games })
+}

export default function Index() {
+	const { games } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
+
+	console.log({ games })

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Hello, world!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Save these changes, then head over to your browser and refresh the page.

Right-click on the page, choose 'Inspect' and check the 'Console' tab.

You should see the game we have loaded from the database displayed in the console:

![Console log of games](src/assets/webp/prisma/log-games.webp)

This is great!

It means that we have successfully loaded data from the server, and passed this across to the client. And all in a single file! ðŸ˜Ž

::::note[Info]

## What is a `loader` function?

### Client vs. server code

Traditionally, React components are executed in the **client**, or in other words, the user's **browser**. This is fine for a lot of web work, but the problem is that database information can only be accessed on the **server**.

The makers of Remix got around this problem by introducing `loader` functions.

### Accessing server data with `loader` functions

All `.tsx` files inside the `routes` folder are known as **route files** in Remix.

If a `loader` function is exported from a **route** file, Remix will run this code on the **server** _before_ the user interface (UI) is rendered.

This ensures that any required data is accessed and processed before the UI is presented by the browser.

Look closely at the flow of data in the following diagram:

![Client server side code](src/assets/png/client-server-side-code.png)

In the example shown here, the `loader` function is getting articles from a database and returning them as JSON data.

This data is then accessed by the `LandingPage` component using the `useLoaderData` hook.

The `articles` are then passed to an `ArticleLinks` component which React renders, along with the rest of the UI, to the user's screen.

You can learn more about `loader` functions via the [**Remix docs**](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/loader).

In our case, we want to use the `games` data to render a list of games on the page.

We will do this in the next section.
