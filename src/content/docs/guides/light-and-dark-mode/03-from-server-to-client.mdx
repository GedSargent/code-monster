title: From server to client - `useLoaderData`
description: Learn how to use the useLoaderData hook to pass data from the server to the client in Remix.

import MonsterDetails from "src/components/MonsterDetails.astro";

If the `loader` function loads prepares data on the server, then `useLoaderData` is the bridge that carries this data across into the user's browser.

## Adding `useLoaderData` to the `App` component

This a [hook](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) supplied by Remix, and is easily called:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/root.tsx"
import { LoaderFunctionArgs, json, type LinksFunction } from '@remix-run/node'
+import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
import AppProvider from '~/components/shared-layout/AppProvider'
import Document from '~/components/shared-layout/Document.tsx'
import { useNonce } from '~/utils/nonce-provider.ts'
import rootLinkElements from '~/utils/rootProviders/rootLinkElements.ts'
+import ThemeSwitch from './components/shared-layout/ThemeSwitch'
import useTheme from './hooks/useTheme'
import { getHints } from './utils/client-hints'
import { getDomainUrl } from './utils/misc'
import { getTheme } from './utils/theme.server'

// Other code omitted for brevity...

export async function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
	const requestInfo = {
		hints: getHints(request),
		origin: getDomainUrl(request),
		path: new URL(request.url).pathname,
		userPrefs: {
			theme: getTheme(request),
		},
	}

	return json({ requestInfo })
}

export function App() {
+	const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();
	const nonce = useNonce();
	const theme = useTheme();

	return (
		<Document nonce={nonce} theme={theme}>
			<div className="flex h-screen flex-col justify-between">
				<div className="flex-1">
					<main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
						<h1 className="text-mega">Welcome to Epic News!</h1>
					</main>
				</div>
+				<div className="container flex justify-between pb-5">
+					<ThemeSwitch userPreference={data.requestInfo.userPrefs.theme} />
+				</div>
		</Document>
	)
}
```

### Review your code

Take a few minutes to review the code you have added.

Can you can understand what it's doing?

Remember you can **<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + click** (or **<kbd>CMD</kbd> + click** on a Mac) on component names to open code you've imported from elsewhere.

When you are ready, open the explanation below.

    #### 1. `useLoaderData` and the `data` object

    ```tsx title="app/root.tsx"
    const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
    ```

    The `useLoaderData` hook provides whatever value is returned from the `loader` function. In this case, we are calling this value `data`, but it's just a variable name, and could be anything we wanted it to be. `useLoaderData` is the bridge connecting the server to the browser.

    So, the `data` variable here represents the object being returned from the `loader` function defined previously. A few lines down, we pass this into the `ThemeSwitch` component:

    ```tsx title="app/root.tsx"
    <ThemeSwitch userPreference={data.requestInfo.userPrefs.theme} />
    ```

    As you can probably guess, this particular bit of the `data` object contains the user's `theme` preferences (i.e. 'light' or 'dark'), and is read directly from a browser [cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies).

    #### 2. The `ThemeSwitch` component

    The `ThemeSwitch` component is simply an icon wrapped inside a Remix [form](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/components/form). It should toggle between 'light' and 'dark' icons clicked, but something isn't quite right yet. Let's see if we can fix it.

## ðŸ¤¨ But `ThemeSwitch` doesn't work..!

Try clicking on the theme switch icon. Unfortunately it doesn't work yet...
