title: ðŸ”€ Routing - 'Outlet' and '_index.tsx'
description: Learn how to create a nested route with the 'Outlet' component and the '_index.tsx' file.
---

At the moment, we only have a single page in our app, but of course we want to add more.

So far, we've been using the `root.tsx` file to render the only page in our app. But as we add more pages, we'll want to use the `root.tsx` file to render the _layout_ that all of our pages share.

## The `Outlet` component

Let's start by swapping out the title text in our `root.tsx` file with a special component that Remix supplies for us: the `Outlet` component.

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/root.tsx" ins="Outlet, "
import { parse } from '@conform-to/zod'
import {
	json,
	type ActionFunctionArgs,
	type LoaderFunctionArgs,
	type LinksFunction,
} from '@remix-run/node'
import { Outlet, useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
import { z } from 'zod'

// Code omitted for brevity

export function App() {
	const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
	const nonce = useNonce()
	const theme = useTheme()

	return (
		<Document nonce={nonce} theme={theme}>
			<div className="flex h-screen flex-col justify-between">
        <HeaderWithSearch />

				<div className="flex-1">
-					<main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
-						<h1 className="text-mega">Welcome to Epic News!</h1>
-					</main>
+					<Outlet />
				</div>

				<div className="container flex justify-between pb-5">
					<ThemeSwitch userPreference={data.requestInfo.userPrefs.theme} />
				</div>
			</div>

      <FooterMenuRight />
		</Document>
	)
}
```

Save your changes and head back across to your browser. Make sure you are on the home page at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the welcome message has changed:

![Hello from _index.tsx screenshot](src/assets/png/hello-from-index-tsx.png)

### Wait - what just happened? ðŸ¤”

Why can we still see the navbar and footer, but the central page content has changed? And where is this new code coming from?

Well - the screenshot itself provides a big clue to this last question!

Open the file at `app/routes/_index.tsx` and you'll find the matching code:

```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
import { type MetaFunction } from "@remix-run/node";

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => [{ title: "Epic News" }];

export default function Index() {
  return (
    <main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
      <h1 className="text-mega">
        Hello from{" "}
        <pre className="prose rounded-lg bg-primary p-6 text-primary-foreground">
          app/routes/_index.tsx
        </pre>
      </h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

So what exactly is happening??

::::tip[Deep Dive]

## The `Outlet` component

`Outlet` is a special Remix component that tells the browser to render a **child route** that matches the current URL.

This is quite a strange concept to understand at first, so let's take some time to understand what this means.

:::info

### ðŸ”€ What is a "route"? ðŸ”€

In a normal web application, a "route" is a URL that corresponds to a specific **page** or **view** in the app. This is usually served from a specific file in the project.

For example, when we run a Remix application on our local machines, the **base URL** is

```bash
http://localhost:3000/
```

In a Remix app, this is initially served from the file at `app/root.tsx`.

However, if we wanted to navigate to a different page - say the 'About Us' page - then we would typically add a new **path** onto the end of the base URL like so:

```bash ins="/about-us" title="URL for the 'About Us' page"
http://localhost:3000/about-us
```

The "route" in this case would then be served from another file in the code base. In a Remix app, this file would typically be found inside the `routes` folder, and called `about-us.tsx`.

### "Parent" and "child" routes

However, in a Remix application, we can make use of something much more powerful - "parent" and "child" routes.

A "child route" is a route that is nested _within_ another route, which we call a "parent route". As soon as we place the `Outlet` component inside a parent route, it tells Remix to render both the parent and the matching child route through it.

#### The main index page of a website

In the case of our app at the moment, the `root.tsx` file is the file being served as the "parent" route, and the `_index.tsx` file is the "child" route.

The reason we can still see the navbar and footer is because the `root.tsx` file is still being served as the parent route. The content that we see in the middle of the page is being served through the `Outlet` component as the child from the `_index.tsx` file.

#### The route structure

Think of routes like a tree structure. The **parent** route is like the trunk of the tree, and the child routes are like the branches that come off the trunk. Each branch can have its own smaller branches, which are like "grandchild" routes.

Routes in Remix are represented by files and folders in your project. The structure of your files and folders directly maps to the structure of your routes.

This is a powerful feature of Remix that will cover this in more detail in the future sections.
