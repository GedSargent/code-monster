title: ðŸ”€ Routing - 'Outlet' and '_index.tsx'
description: Learn how to create a nested route with the 'Outlet' component and the '_index.tsx' file.
---

At the moment, we only have a single page in our app, but of course we want to add more.

So far, we've been using the `root.tsx` file to render the only page in our app. But as we add more pages, we'll want to use the `root.tsx` file to render the _layout_ that all of our pages share.

## The `Outlet` component

Let's start by swapping out the title text in our `root.tsx` file with a special component that Remix supplies for us: the `Outlet` component.

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/root.tsx" ins="Outlet, "
import { parse } from '@conform-to/zod'
import {
	json,
	type ActionFunctionArgs,
	type LoaderFunctionArgs,
	type LinksFunction,
} from '@remix-run/node'
import { Outlet, useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
import { z } from 'zod'

// Code omitted for brevity

export function App() {
	const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
	const nonce = useNonce()
	const theme = useTheme()

	return (
		<Document nonce={nonce} theme={theme}>
			<div className="flex h-screen flex-col justify-between">
        <HeaderWithSearch />

				<div className="flex-1">
-					<main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
-						<h1 className="text-mega">Welcome to Epic News!</h1>
-					</main>
+					<Outlet />
				</div>

				<div className="container flex justify-between pb-5">
					<ThemeSwitch userPreference={data.requestInfo.userPrefs.theme} />
				</div>
			</div>

      <FooterMenuRight />
		</Document>
	)
}
```

Save your changes and head back across to your browser. You should see the welcome message has changed:

![Hello from _index.tsx screenshot](src/assets/png/hello-from-index-tsx.png)

### Wait - what just happened? ðŸ¤”

Why can we still see the navbar and footer, but the central page content has changed? And where is this new code coming from?

Well - the screenshot itself provides a big clue to this last question!

Open the file at `app/routes/_index.tsx` and you'll find the matching code:

```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
import { type MetaFunction } from "@remix-run/node";

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => [{ title: "Epic News" }];

export default function Index() {
  return (
    <main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
      <h1 className="text-mega">
        Hello from{" "}
        <pre className="prose rounded-lg bg-primary p-6 text-primary-foreground">
          app/routes/_index.tsx
        </pre>
      </h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

So what exactly is happening??

::::tip[Deep Dive]

## The `Outlet` component

The `Outlet` component is a special Remix component that tells the browser to render the **child route** that matches the current URL.

:::info

### What is a "route"?

In a normal web application, a "route" is a URL that corresponds to a specific page or view in the app.

When we run a Remix application on our local machines, the **base URL** is

```bash
http://localhost:3000/
```

The "route" in this case is the base page of our website, which in a Remix app is served from `app/root.tsx`.

However, if we wanted to navigate to a different page, say the 'About Us' page, then we would typically add the new **path** onto the end of the base URL like so:

```bash ins="/about-us" title="URL for the 'About Us' page"
http://localhost:3000/about-us
```

The "route" in this case would be served from a file inside the `routes` folder called `about-us.tsx`, a completely different file.

### "Parent" and "child" routes

However, in a Remix application, we can make use of something much more powerful - "parent" and "child" routes.

A "child route" is a route that is nested _within_ another route, which we call a "parent route".

In this case, the child route is the `_index.tsx` file.

#### The main index page of a website

When you fire up your server, navigating to `http://localhost:3000/` will render main **index** page for the app. Initially, this is page is served by the `root.tsx` file.

However, the `Outlet` component tells Remix to render the child route that matches the current URL. In this case, the child route is the `_index.tsx` file.

#### The route structure

Think of routes like a tree structure. The **parent** route is like the trunk of the tree, and the child routes are like the branches that come off the trunk. Each branch can have its own smaller branches, which are like "grandchild" routes.

Routes in Remix are represented by files and folders in your project. The structure of your files and folders directly maps to the structure of your routes.

This is a powerful feature of Remix that will cover this in more detail in the future sections.
