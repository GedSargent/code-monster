title: ðŸ”€ Routing - `Outlet` and `_index.tsx`
description: Learn how to create a nested route with the 'Outlet' component and the '_index.tsx' file.

import NestedRouting from "src/components/epicNews/NestedRouting.astro";

At the moment, we only have a single page in our app, but of course we want to add more.

So far, we've been using the `root.tsx` file to render the only page in our app. But as we add more pages, we'll want to use the `root.tsx` file to render the _layout_ that all of our pages share.

## The `Outlet` component

Let's start by swapping out the title text in our `root.tsx` file with a special component that Remix supplies for us: the `Outlet` component.

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/root.tsx" ins="Outlet, "
import { parse } from '@conform-to/zod'
import {
	json,
	type ActionFunctionArgs,
	type LoaderFunctionArgs,
	type LinksFunction,
} from '@remix-run/node'
import { Outlet, useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
import { z } from 'zod'

// Code omitted for brevity

export default function App() {
	const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
	const nonce = useNonce()
	const theme = useTheme()

	return (
		<Document nonce={nonce} theme={theme}>
			<div className="flex h-screen flex-col justify-between">
        <HeaderWithSearch />

				<div className="flex-1">
-					<main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
-						<h1 className="text-mega">Welcome to Epic News!</h1>
-					</main>
+					<Outlet />
				</div>

				<div className="container flex justify-between pb-5">
					<ThemeSwitch userPreference={data.requestInfo.userPrefs.theme} />
				</div>

      <FooterMenuRight />
			</div>
		</Document>
	)
}
```

Save your changes and head back across to your browser. Make sure you are on the home page at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the welcome message has changed:

![Hello from _index.tsx screenshot](src/assets/png/hello-from-index-tsx.png)

### Wait - what just happened? ðŸ¤”

Why can we still see the navbar and footer, but the central page content has changed? And where is this new code coming from?

Well - the screenshot itself provides a big clue to this last question!

Open the file at `app/routes/_index.tsx` and you'll find the matching code:

```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
import { type MetaFunction } from "@remix-run/node";

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => [{ title: "Epic News" }];

export default function Index() {
  return (
    <main className="grid h-full place-items-center">
      <h1 className="text-mega">
        Hello from{" "}
        <pre className="prose rounded-lg bg-primary p-6 text-primary-foreground">
          app/routes/_index.tsx
        </pre>
      </h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

So what exactly is happening here??

::::tip[Deep Dive]

## The `Outlet` component

`Outlet` is a special Remix component that tells the browser to render a **child route** that matches the current URL.

This is quite a strange concept to understand at first, so let's take some time to understand what this means.

:::info

### ðŸ”€ What is a "route"? ðŸ”€

In a normal web application, a "route" is a URL that corresponds to a specific **page** or **view** in the app. This is usually served from a specific file in the project.

For example, when we run a Remix application on our local machines, the **base URL** is

```bash
http://localhost:3000/
```

In a Remix app, this is initially served from the file at `app/root.tsx`.

However, if we wanted to navigate to a different page - say the 'About Us' page - then we would typically add a new **path** onto the end of the base URL like so:

```bash ins="/about-us" title="URL for the 'About Us' page"
http://localhost:3000/about-us
```

The "route" in this case would then be served from another file in the code base. In a Remix app, this file would typically be found inside the `routes` folder, and called `about-us.tsx`.

### "Parent" and "child" routes

However, in a Remix application, we can make use of something much more powerful - "parent" and "child" routes.

A "child route" is a route that is nested _within_ another route, which we call a "parent route". As soon as we place the `Outlet` component inside a parent route, it tells Remix to render both the parent and the matching child route through it.

#### The main index page of a website

In the case of our app at the moment, the `root.tsx` file is being served as the "parent" route, and the `_index.tsx` file is the "child" route.

The reason we can still see the navbar and footer is because this is code being served from the **parent** `root.tsx` file. The content that we see in the middle of the page is being served from the `_index.tsx` file as the **child**:

<NestedRouting />

This is a powerful feature of Remix that will explore in more detail later.

::::

## The route structure

Routes in Remix are represented by files and folders in your project. The structure of your files and folders directly maps to the structure of your routes.

Think of the `Outlet` component as a "window" or "placeholder" for the child route. It's a way of telling Remix where to render the child route inside the parent route.

We can see this in action by adding a new route to our app. Let's add a dummy 'about us' page.

### Adding a new route

Create a new file at `app/routes/about-us.tsx`:

![About us page file](src/assets/png/add-new-route.png)

:::danger[Extra care]

### Route file names in Remix

Take extra care when naming your route files in Remix. The file name must **match** the URL path that you want to serve from it.

For example, because we want to serve a page from the URL path `/about-us`, then the file name must **also** be `about-us.tsx`.

If it was named `aboutUs.tsx` or `about_us.tsx`, then Remix would not be able to serve the page from the correct URL.

:::

Inside this new file, add the following code and save your changes:

```tsx title="app/routes/about-us.tsx"
export default function AboutUs() {
  return (
    <main className="container">
      <h1 className="text-mega">About us</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Head back over to your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/about-us](http://localhost:3000/about-us). You should see the new 'About us' page:

![About us page navigation](src/assets/gif/about-us-page.gif)

Notice how the navbar, footer and theme switcher are still present on the page? This is because `/about-us` is a direct child of the base URL, so the `Outlet` component in the `root.tsx` file now provides a "window" into the `about-us.tsx` code.

This is a powerful feature of Remix that we will be exploring in more detail later.

:::tip[Your turn]

### Challenge

Add a new routes to your app that serve pages from the URL paths below. For the time being, you can just add a simple title to each page.

1. `/contact-us`
2. `/news`
3. `/account`

#### Extra credit ðŸš€ðŸš€

What other top-level pages do you think a site like Epic News might need? Add them to your app and give them each a simple placeholder title for the time being.
