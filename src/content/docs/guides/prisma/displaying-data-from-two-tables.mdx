It would be great if we could also display the category of each game on the page, but category information is stored in a separate table.

Let's see how we can fetch data from two tables from a single request.

## Start the development server

If you need to, start the development server by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Data in React

Look again at the shape of the data we fetched in the [**previous step**](/code-monster/guides/prisma/reading-data):

```ts
games: [
	{
		id: 'cm7s2xqfx0000xiv0eig2y3va',
		title: 'The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild',
		description: 'An open-world adventure game set in the kingdom of Hyrule.',
		price: 59.99,
		rating: 4.9,
		releaseDate: '2017-03-03T00:00:00.000Z',
		createdAt: '2025-03-02T20:24:32.541Z',
		updatedAt: '2025-03-02T20:24:32.541Z'
	},
	{
		id: 'cm7s2xqg00001xiv0adp4zac7',
		title: 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt',
		description: 'An action RPG set in a fantasy world full of monsters and magic.',
		price: 39.99,
		rating: 4.8,
		releaseDate: '2015-05-19T00:00:00.000Z',
		createdAt: '2025-03-02T20:24:32.545Z',
		updatedAt: '2025-03-02T20:24:32.545Z'
	},
	// ... more games here...
]
```

Notice the square brackets `[]` around the object? This means that `games` is an [***array***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Arrays) of objects.

We need some way to take each of these objects and display their properties on the page.

But how? 🤔

## The `map` function

The [`map` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) in JavaScript allows us to loop through an array and apply a function to each element, returning a new array with the results.

::::note[Example]

Let's see how the `map` function works with a simple example.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((number) => {
  return number * 2;
});

console.log(doubledNumbers); // -> [2, 4, 6]
console.log(numbers); // -> [1, 2, 3]
```

<MonsterReveal title="🧑‍💻 Explanation">

We start with an array of `numbers`.

```ts
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
```

We use the `map` function to loop through each number and multiply it by 2. The result is a ***new array*** with the doubled numbers.

```ts
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((number) => {
  return number * 2;
});
```

We store this new array in the `doubledNumbers` variable and log it to the console.

```ts
console.log(doubledNumbers); // -> [2, 4, 6]
```

:::caution[Important]

Note that when we `console.log` the original `numbers` array, it remains unchanged.

```ts
console.log('Original numbers:');
console.log(numbers); // -> [1, 2, 3]
```

The `map` function ***does not modify the original array***, it returns a completely new one.

:::

If you want to learn more about the `map` function, I recommend reading the excellent [**MDN documentation**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) to understand it better.

::::

Now that we understand how the `map` function works, let's see how we can use it in React to display a list of items.

## Rendering arrays in React components

It turns out that React automatically renders the content of an array directly to the screen when used in JSX.

We can see this if we replace the main page title with an array of strings:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/_index.tsx" showLineNumbers collapse={1-19} ins="{["Hello", "World!"]}"
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { json } from '@remix-run/node'
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
import type { MetaFunction } from "@remix-run/node";

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => {
  return [
    { title: "New Remix App" },
    { name: "description", content: "Welcome to Remix!" },
  ];
};

export async function loader() {
  const prisma = new PrismaClient()

  const games = await prisma.game.findMany()

  return json({ games })
}

export default function Index() {
  const { games } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

  console.log({ games })
  
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">{["Hello", "World!"]}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

If you check the browser, you will see that the page title is now "HelloWorld!":

![Title as array](src/assets/webp/prisma/title-as-array.webp)

### Arrays of React components

If we take this a step further, what do you think will happen if we replace the plain strings inside this array with full React components?

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
export default function Index() {
  const { games } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

  console.log({ games })

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
-      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">{["Hello", "World!"]}</h1>
+				<h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">
+					{[
+            <span key="1" className="border border-red-500 p-2 text-red-500">
+              Hello
+            </span>,
+            <span key="2" className="border border-green-500 p-2 text-green-500">
+              World!
+            </span>
+					]}
+				</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Head back to your browser, and you should see the page title has changed again:

![MyBrilliantArticles styled](src/assets/webp/prisma/title-as-array-styled.webp)

With this knowledge in mind, let's think how we can use the `map` function to dynamically render our list of `games`.

:::caution[Before you continue]

If you were following the previous steps and altering code, make sure to revert your page title back to its original state before continuing.

(Unless you like the new look, of course! 😄)

:::

## Using `map` to loop through an array of items

Let's recap what we know so far:

1. If we embed an array inside some JSX, React will automatically render the elements of this array straight out to the screen.
2. The `map` function ***produces a new array from an existing one*** by applying a **callback function** to each element, e.g.

```ts mark="(number) => {" mark="  return number * 2" mark="}"
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((number) => {
  return number * 2;
});
```

:::tip[Aha!]

<p class="text-center text-8xl">💡</p>

This means that we can use the `map` function to loop through an array of objects (like our `games` array) and return a ***new array of components***.

:::

Let's see how we can use this to display a list of games.

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
export default function Index() {
  const { games } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();
-
-  console.log({ games });

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
+      <div>
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Hello, World!</h1>
+        {games.map((game) => (
+          <div key={game.id}>
+            <h2>{game.title}</h2>
+          </div>
+        ))}
+      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Save the changes to your file and check the browser. You should see that the game titles are now displayed on screen:

![Unstyled game title list](src/assets/webp/prisma/unstyled-game-title-list.webp)

## Summary

In this step, we learned how to use the `map` function to loop through an array of items and display a list of game titles from our database.

There are many more JavaScript array functions that can be used to manipulate arrays in different ways. Below are a few examples for you to research further and experiment with:

- `find`: returns the first element that passes a test
- `some`: returns `true` if at least one element in an array passes a test
- `every`: returns `true` if all elements in an array pass a test
- `includes`: returns `true` if an array contains a certain element
- `filter`: returns a new array of elements that pass a certain test or condition
- `reduce`: reduces an array to a single value

Kent C. Dodds has a great game on [**JavaScript to know for React**](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react#array-methods) that demonstrates these methods in action.

:::tip[Challenge]

1. Display the price of each game along with its title.
2. Make sure each price contains a `£` sign before it.
