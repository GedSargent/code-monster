## What is Prisma?

Prisma is a modern database toolkit that makes database setup and access easy in any NodeJS-based project like Remix.

It uses Typescript to define the database schema and provides a powerful query engine to access the database.

It is a replacement for traditional ORMs and data access libraries.

### Example Prima Query

Take a look at the following example Prisma query:

![Prisma Query](src/assets/svg/prisma-query-example.svg)

Take a minute to read through this carefully. Can you work out what this database query is looking for?

<MonsterDetails>
  <div>
    1. Firstly, we are querying the `User` table.
    2. We are asking for a unique user `where` the `email` field is `alice@prisma.io`.
    3. We are then asking for the `posts` that this user has written.
    4. Finally, we are asking for the `post` where the `title` matches a certain condition which we haven't described yet.
  </div>
</MonsterDetails>
