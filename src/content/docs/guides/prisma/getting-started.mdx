## What is Prisma?

Prisma is a modern database toolkit that makes database setup and access easy in a NodeJS-based project like Remix.

It uses Typescript to define the database schema and provides a powerful query engine to access the database.

### Example Prima Query

Take a look at the following example Prisma query:

![Prisma Query](src/assets/svg/prisma-query-example.svg)

Take a minute to read through this carefully. See if you can work out what the query is asking the database for before reading the solution below.

<MonsterReveal>
  <div>
    1. Firstly, we are querying the `User` table.

    ```tsx
      await prisma.user
    ```

    2. We are asking the database to find a single, unique user `where` the `email` field is `alice@prisma.io`.

    ```tsx
      await prisma.user
        .findUnique({
          where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' }
        })
    ```

    3. We are then asking for the `posts` that this user has written.

    ```tsx
      .findUnique({
        where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' }
      })
      .posts
    ```

    4. Finally, we are asking for the `post` where the `title` `contains` a certain word or string which we haven't described yet.

    ```tsx
      .posts({
        where: { title: { contains: '...' } }
      })
    ```
  </div>

There are lots of resources online to help you get started with Prisma. Some of the best have been collected for you in the [resources](/code-monster/reference/prisma-learning-resources/) section of this site.

For now, let's get started with the Prisma schema.
