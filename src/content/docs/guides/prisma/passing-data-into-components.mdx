description: Using props to display data in a component
---

import MonsterReveal from 'src/components/MonsterReveal.astro'

In the [**previous step**](/code-monster/guides/prisma/displaying-data), we displayed a list of game titles on the page.

In this step, we will pass the game data into a component so that we can display the information in a more user-friendly way.

## Understanding Props in React Components

React components can accept inputs called "props" (short for properties). Props allow us to pass data from a parent component to a child component, making our components reusable with different data.

## Step 1: Define Props for the GameCard Component

First, we need to define what props our `GameCard` component will accept. We'll create an interface to specify the expected props and their types.

```diff lang="tsx"  title="app/components/GameCard.tsx"
+interface GameCardProps {
+  title: string;
+  releaseDate: string;
+}
+export default function GameCard({ title, releaseDate }: GameCardProps) {
+  const formattedDate = releaseDate.substring(0, 10);
```

:::note
TypeScript interfaces help us define the shape of objects. Here, we're creating an interface called `GameCardProps` that specifies our component will receive two props: `title` and `releaseDate`, both of type string.
:::

## Step 2: Update the GameCard Component to Use Props

Now that we've defined our props, we need to update the component to use them instead of hardcoded values.

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/components/GameCard.tsx"
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <div className="relative h-72 overflow-hidden">
        <img
          src="https://picsum.photos/400/300"
          alt="Game Cover"
          className="w-full object-cover rounded-md"
        />
      </div>
      <div className="flex justify-between">
        <div className="flex flex-col justify-between w-2/3">
-          <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl text-slate-300">Game Title</h3>
+          <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl text-slate-300">{title}</h3>
          <p className="text-cyan-300 uppercase text-sm font-semibold">Genre</p>
-          <p className="text-slate-200/60 text-sm font-semibold">Start date</p>
+          <p className="text-slate-200/60 text-sm font-semibold">
+            {formattedDate}
+          </p>
        </div>
```

:::note[Expression slots]
We're using curly braces `{}` to insert JavaScript expressions into our JSX. This allows us to display the dynamic values passed through props.

We're also formatting the date by using `substring(0, 10)` to show only the first 10 characters of the date string (YYYY-MM-DD format).
:::

## Step 3: Update the Index Route to Pass Props to GameCard

Finally, we need to update our index route to pass the game data to the `GameCard` component.

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
  return (
-    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
-      <div>
-        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Hello, World!</h1>
-        <GameCard />
-        {games.map((game) => (
-          <div key={game.id}>
-            <h2>{game.title}</h2>
-          </div>
-        ))}
-      </div>
+    <div className="container mx-auto px-8 grid grid-cols-3 gap-8">
+      {games.map((game) => (
+        <div key={game.id}>
+          <GameCard
+            key={game.id}
+            title={game.title}
+            releaseDate={game.releaseDate}
+          />
+        </div>
+      ))}
    </div>
  );
```

:::note
We're using the `map()` method to iterate over each game in our array and create a `GameCard` component for each one.

The `key` prop is a special React prop that helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed. It should be a unique identifier, which is why we're using `game.id`.

We're also updating our layout to use a grid with 3 columns, which will display our game cards in a more visually appealing way.

## What We've Learned

In this tutorial, we've:

1. Created a TypeScript interface to define the props for our `GameCard` component
2. Updated the `GameCard` component to use these props instead of hardcoded values
3. Modified our index route to pass game data to the `GameCard` component
4. Improved the layout of our page using CSS Grid

Now our application displays each game from the database in a visually appealing card format, making the information more user-friendly and organized.

<MonsterReveal>
  Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to pass data from a parent component to a child component using props. This is a fundamental concept in React that allows you to create reusable components that can display different data based on the props they receive.
