All database interactions begin with the Prisma [**schema**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/overview).

This can be found in the `prisma/schema.prisma` file in the root of the project.

The schema is a file that defines the database tables and their fields. It also defines the relationships between the tables.

Let's take a look at the Prisma schema for the starter Remix project you have been working from:

![Prisma Schema](src/assets/png/prisma/prisma-schema-start.png)

:::note[Info]

So far, the schema is virtually empty. It defines a `generator` that Prisma uses to generate the client library for the database, and source of the database file that Prisma will connect our application to.

In this case, the source is a SQLite database, which is a file-based database that is easy to set up and use for development purposes.

### The .env file and .gitignore

Let's take a moment to look at the `DATABASE_URL` line in the schema:

```tsx
url     = env("DATABASE_URL")
```

What exactly *is* `"DATABASE_URL"`? And where does it come from?

`"DATABASE_URL"` is an [**environment variable**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-environment-variables-and-how-can-i-use-them-with-gatsby-and-netlify/#what-are-environment-variables) that Prisma uses to connect to the database. It is defined in the `.env` file in the root of the project.

If you open the `.env` file, you will see that the value of `DATABASE_URL` is set to a connection string pointing to the SQLite database file:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

![Dev.db file](src/assets/png/prisma/dev-db-file.png)

So why not just put this directly into the Prisma schema?

The answer is **security**.

The `.env` file is a place to keep sensitive information like database connection strings out of a version control repository like Github.

Remember that every time you make a commit to a Git repository, you are potentially sharing your code with the world. If you commit a file that contains sensitive information, you are potentially sharing that information with the world too.

To stop this from happening, we would usually add the `.env` file to the `.gitignore` file in the root of the project. As the name suggests, this file contains a list of files and folders thats Git ignores when making commits.

![.gitignore file](src/assets/png/prisma/gitignore-file.png)

#### But where is the .env file here?

Because this is an educational project and there is no sensitive information that will be added, we've removed the `.env` file from `.gitignore` to prevent any confusion during the initial setup stage.

In a real-world project, you would add the `.env` file to `.gitignore` and ensure it was never committed to the version control history from the outset.

## Adding a Model to the Schema

We will start by adding a [**model**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/models) to the schema. A model is just a description of how a table should be created in the database.

Let's go ahead, and add a `User` model to the very bottom of the schema file:

```diff lang="tsx" title="prisma/schema.prisma"
// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
+
+model User {
+  id    String @id @default(cuid())
+  email String @unique
+
+  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
+  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
+}
```

Take a moment to work out what you think this model doing. What fields does the `User` table have? What are the `@` symbols doing?

<MonsterReveal title='Defining the User model'>
  <div>
    Let's break this down line by line:

    ```tsx
    id    String @id @default(cuid())
    ```
    `id` is a unique identifier for the user. It is a string and is a unique string of characters automatically generated using the `cuid()` function. The `@id` attribute tells Prisma that this field is the primary key for the table.

    ```tsx
    email String @unique
    ```

    `email` is a string, and of course stores the email address of the user. The `@unique` attribute tells Prisma that this field must be unique for each user. If more that one user tries to sign up with the same email address, the database will throw an error.

    ```tsx
    createdAt DateTime @default(now())
    updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
    ```

    `createdAt` and `updatedAt` are both date and time fields. `createdAt` is automatically set to the current date and time when a new user is created. `updatedAt` is automatically updated to the current date and time whenever the user is updated.
  </div>
</MonsterReveal>

## Applying changes to the database

So far, we've told Prisma how we want the User table to look in the database, but we haven't actually made any changes to the database itself yet.

We need to push these changes to the database using something called a [**migration**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/getting-started).

A migration is a file that translates the changes we've made to the Prisma schema into SQL commands that can be run on the database.

### Creating a migration file

If your server is still running, stop it by pressing <MonsterKbd>Ctrl + C</MonsterKbd> in your terminal.

To create a migration with the name of `add-user-model`, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-user-model
```

This command tells Prisma to create a new migration file with the name `add-user-model`. The `dev` flag tells Prisma to run the migration on the database.

When you run this command, Prisma will generate a new migration file in the `prisma/migrations` directory. The file will contain the SQL commands needed to create the `User` table in the database.

If all is well, you should see a confirmation message that looks something like this in your terminal:

![User migrate confirmation](src/assets/png/prisma/user-migrate-confirmation.png)

You should also be able to see the new migration file in the `prisma/migrations` directory.

Next, we will use Prisma Studio to view the changes we've made to the database.
