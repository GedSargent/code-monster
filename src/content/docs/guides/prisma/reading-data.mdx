title: Reading data - loader functions
description: Reading data from a database using Prisma and Remix
---

:::danger[Prerequisites]

Make sure that you have completed the lesson on [**seeding data**](/code-monster/guides/prisma/seed-files) before starting this one.

:::

We are now ready to read data from the database using Prisma and Remix. We will start by creating a new route that will display a list of all the articles in the database.

## Start the development server

Start the development server by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Create a new route

Create a new file called `articles.tsx` inside the `app/routes` directory:

![Create articles route](src/assets/png/prisma/articles-route-file.png)

Add the following code to the file, and save your changes:

```tsx title="app/routes/articles.tsx"
import HomeButton from '~/components/challenges/HomeButton'

function Article() {
	return (
		<div className="flex h-96 w-96 items-center justify-center justify-self-center rounded-xl bg-white/20">
			<p className="text-center text-4xl text-gray-300">Article</p>
		</div>
	)
}

export default function ArticlesRoute() {
	return (
		<main className="min-h-screen">
			<div className="container mx-auto py-28">
				<HomeButton />
				<h1 className="mb-32 text-center text-8xl font-bold text-white">
					Articles
				</h1>

				<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
					<Article />
					<Article />
				</div>
			</div>
		</main>
	)
}
```

With your server still running, head back to your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/articles`.

You should see a page with the title "Articles" and two "Article" component placeholders, like this:

![Articles page start](src/assets/png/prisma/articles-page-start.png)

## Fetch data from the database

We now need to fetch the articles from the database and display them on the page.

We will do this by adding a Remix [**loader function**](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/loader) to the `articles.tsx` file:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/articles.tsx" showLineNumbers collapse={14-20, 27-41}
+import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
+import { json } from '@remix-run/node'
+import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
import HomeButton from '~/components/challenges/HomeButton'

+export async function loader() {
+	const prisma = new PrismaClient()
+
+	const articles = await prisma.article.findMany()
+
+	return json({ articles })
+}

function Article() {
	return (
		<div className="flex h-96 w-96 items-center justify-center justify-self-center rounded-xl bg-white/20">
			<p className="text-center text-4xl text-gray-300">Article</p>
		</div>
	)
}

export default function ArticlesRoute() {
+	const { articles } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
+
+	console.log({ articles })

	return (
		<main className="min-h-screen">
			<div className="container mx-auto py-28">
				<HomeButton />
				<h1 className="mb-32 text-center text-8xl font-bold text-white">
					Articles
				</h1>

				<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
					<Article />
					<Article />
				</div>
			</div>
		</main>
	)
}
```

If you save these changes, then head over to your browser and refresh the page, you should see the articles we have loaded from the database displayed in the console:

```bash title="Console"
GET / 200 - - 69.668 ms
{
  articles: [
    {
      id: 'cltu63o8x0002moxjqz269ef3',
      title: 'My first article!',
      content: 'Hello, world!',
      createdAt: '2024-03-16T14:12:48.129Z',
      updatedAt: '2024-03-16T14:12:48.129Z',
      authorId: 'cltu63o8u0000moxj5dfh8xqn'
    },
    {
      id: 'cltu63o8y0004moxj47f5fcpt',
      title: 'My second article',
      content: 'Hello again, world!',
      createdAt: '2024-03-16T14:12:48.131Z',
      updatedAt: '2024-03-16T14:12:48.131Z',
      authorId: 'cltu63o8u0000moxj5dfh8xqn'
    }
  ]
}
GET /articles 200 - - 38.458 ms
```

This is great!

It means that we have successfully loaded data from the server, and passed this across to the client. And all in a single file! ðŸ˜Ž

::::note[Info]

## What is a `loader` function?

### Client vs. server code

Traditionally, React components are executed in the **client**, or in other words, the user's **browser**. This is fine for a lot of web work, but the problem is that database information can only be accessed on the **server**.

The makers of Remix got around this problem by introducing `loader` functions.

### Accessing server data with `loader` functions

If a `loader` function is exported from a **route** file (i.e. from a `tsx` file placed inside the `routes` folder), then Remix will execute this code on the **server** _before_ the user interface (UI) is rendered. This ensures that any required data is accessed and processed before the UI is presented by the browser.

Look closely at the flow of data in the following diagram:

![Client server side code](src/assets/png/client-server-side-code.png)

In the example shown here, the `loader` function is getting the articles from the database and returning them as JSON data.

This data is then accessed by the `LandingPage` component using the `useLoaderData` hook.

The `articles` are then passed to an `ArticleLinks` component which React renders, along with the rest of the UI, to the user's screen.

:::tip

You can learn more about `loader` functions via the [**Remix docs**](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/loader).

In our case, we want to use the `articles` data to render a list of articles on the page.

Let's update our code to do just this.
