title: 🖥️ Displaying data - the `map` function
description: Using map to loop through a list of objects
---

In our previous step, we learned how to pass information to child components in the form of props.

The only problem is that we are defining the same component multiple times. This is not very efficient and can lead to a lot of repetition. It also doesn't scale well if we have a lot of items to display. And what if we don't know how many items we have to display?

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `map` function to loop through a list of objects more efficiently.

## The `map` function

The `map` function in JavaScript allows us to loop through an array and apply a function to each element, returning a new array with the results.

::::note[Info]

Before we see how this can be applied in React, let's quickly see how the `map` function works with a simple JavaScript example.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((number) => {
  return number * 2;
});

console.log(doubledNumbers); // -> [2, 4, 6]
console.log(numbers); // -> [1, 2, 3]
```

In this example, we have an array of `numbers`.

We use the `map` function to loop through each number and multiply it by 2. The result is a ***new array*** with the doubled numbers.

We store this new array in the `doubledNumbers` variable and log it to the console.

:::caution

Note that when we `console.log` the original `numbers` array, it remains unchanged.

The `map` function ***does not modify the original array***, it returns a completely new one.

:::

If you want to learn more about the `map` function, I recommend reading the excellent [**MDN documentation**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) to understand it better.

::::

Now that we understand how the `map` function works, let's see how we can use it in React to display a list of items.

## Rendering arrays in React components

The first thing to understand is that React will automatically render any content of an array within JSX straight out to the screen.

We can see this if we replace the main page title with an array of strings:

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/articles.tsx"
export default function ArticlesRoute() {
	const { articles } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

	return (
		<main className="min-h-screen">
			<div className="container mx-auto py-28">
				<HomeButton />
				<h1 className="mb-32 text-center text-8xl font-bold text-white">
-         Articles
+					{['My', 'Brilliant', 'Articles']}
				</h1>

				<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
					<Article title={articles[0].title} />
					<Article title={articles[1].title} />
				</div>
			</div>
		</main>
	)
}
```

If you check the browser, you will see that the page title is now "MyBrilliantArticles":

![MyBrilliantArticles](src/assets/png/prisma/my-brilliant-articles.png)

### Arrays of React components

If we take this a step further, what do you think will happen if we replace the plain strings inside this array with full React components?

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/articles.tsx"
export default function ArticlesRoute() {
	const { articles } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

	return (
		<main className="min-h-screen">
			<div className="container mx-auto py-28">
				<HomeButton />
				<h1 className="mb-32 text-center text-8xl font-bold text-white">
-					{['My', 'Brilliant', 'Articles']}
+					{[
+						<span key="1" className="border border-red-500 p-2 text-red-500">
+							My
+						</span>,
+						<span
+							key="2"
+							className="border border-green-500 p-2 text-green-500"
+						>
+							Brilliant
+						</span>,
+						<span key="3" className="border border-blue-500 p-2 text-blue-500">
+							Articles
+						</span>,
+					]}
				</h1>

				<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
					<Article title={articles[0].title} />
					<Article title={articles[1].title} />
				</div>
			</div>
		</main>
	)
}
```

Head back to your browser, and you should see the page title has changed again:

![MyBrilliantArticles styled](src/assets/png/prisma/my-brilliant-articles-styled.png)

With this knowledge in mind, let's think how we can use the `map` function to dynamically render our list of `articles`.

:::caution[Before you continue]

If you were following the previous steps and altering code, make sure to revert your page title back to its original state before continuing.

(Unless you like the new look, of course! 😄)

## Using `map` to loop through an array of items

Let's recap what we know so far:

1. If we embed an array inside some JSX, React will automatically render the elements of this array straight out to the screen.
2. The `map` function ***produces a new array from an existing one*** by applying a **callback function** to each element, e.g.

```ts mark="(number) => {" mark="  return number * 2" mark="}"
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((number) => {
  return number * 2;
});
```

:::tip[Aha!]

<p class="text-center text-8xl">💡</p>

This means that we can use the `map` function to loop through an array of objects (like our `articles` array) and return a ***new array of components***.

:::

Let's see how we can use this to display a list of articles.

```diff lang="tsx" title="app/routes/articles.tsx"
export default function ArticlesRoute() {
	const { articles } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

	return (
		<main className="min-h-screen">
			<div className="container mx-auto py-28">
				<HomeButton />
				<h1 className="mb-32 text-center text-8xl font-bold text-white">
					Articles
				</h1>

				<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
-					<Article title={articles[0].title} />
-					<Article title={articles[1].title} />
+					{articles.map(article => (
+						<Article key={article.id} title={article.title} />
+					))}
				</div>
			</div>
		</main>
	)
}
```

Save the changes to your file and check the browser. You should see that the articles are still being displayed as before:

![Articles with titles](src/assets/png/prisma/articles-with-titles.png)

The big advantage this time, of course, is that if we add more articles to our `articles` array, they will be automatically displayed on the page without us having to define a new `Article` component for each one.

This is a much more efficient way to display a list of items, and it scales well with the number of items we have.

## Summary

In this step, we learned how to use the `map` function to loop through an array of items and return a new array of components.

This is a much more efficient way to display a list of items, and it scales well with the number of items we have.

There are many more JavaScript array functions that can be used to manipulate arrays in different ways. Below are a few examples for you to research further and experiment with:

- `find`: returns the first element that passes a test
- `some`: returns `true` if at least one element in an array passes a test
- `every`: returns `true` if all elements in an array pass a test
- `includes`: returns `true` if an array contains a certain element
- `filter`: returns a new array of elements that pass a certain test or condition
- `reduce`: reduces an array to a single value

Kent C. Dodds has a great article on [**JavaScript to know for React**](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react#array-methods) that demonstrates these methods in action.

:::tip[Challenge]

1. Try adding more articles to the `articles` array and see how they are automatically displayed on the page. You could either do this via Prisma Studio or by adding more articles to the `articles` array with code.
2. See if you can update the `Article` model to include a `description` field and display this alongside the `title` in the `Article` component.
3. Add an `imageUrl` field to the `Article` model and display this as an image alongside the `title` and `description` in the `Article` component.
4. Build out the rest of your articles page to include a full design and any other content you think would be useful.
