## The problem

Remind yourself of the problem you are trying to solve.

Harmony Music is an online teaching service. They specialise in music tuition at both beginner and advanced levels.

They have approached you to build a sign-up page for their website. It should meet the following requirements:

<Card title="Harmony Music Sign-up Page">

1. The sign-up form should capture the user's email address, their level (beginner or advanced), and the number of hours they wish to study per week
2. Beginners can request a maximum of 5 hours tuition per week
3. Advanced students can request up to 10 hours per week
4. All subscribers must specify at least one hour of tuition per week
5. Before proceeding, we will need to validate that the user has selected a level, that they have provided an email address, that they have specified at least one hour of study, and that the number of hours requested is within the allowed range
6. Beginner levels are charged at £12.25 per hour, advanced levels are charged at £15.50 per hour
7. The total cost will be calculated by multiplying the number of hours requested by the hourly rate
8. Total cost should be displayed in GBP, and on the same page as the sign-up form
9. Upon successful submission of the form, the subscriber should be shown a summary of their request and the total cost

## Flowchart planning

With your list of requirements in hand, you can plan the flow of the sign-up page logic.

Head over to [Figma](https://www.figma.com) and create a flowchart from scratch that plots out the logic of the sign-up page.

:::note

Remember the different blocks used in a flowchart:

- Start/End
- Process
- Decision
- Input/Output

FigJam's shape library has a range of flowchart shapes you can use, and you can use connectors to link them together.

## Summary

In this guide, you have:

- Reminded yourself of the requirements for the Harmony Music sign-up page
- Planned the logic of the sign-up page using a flowchart

## Next steps

In the next step, you will link together the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files required for the sign-up page.
