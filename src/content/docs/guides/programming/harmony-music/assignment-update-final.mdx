### Recording your work

- Make sure to document each step of your project in your assignment.
  - Think about how you can explain your work to someone who has never seen your project before.
  - Use clear language and avoid jargon where possible. Where you need to use technical terms, make sure to explain them.
  - Jusify the choices behind each step taken so far in the project.
- Include any code snippets, diagrams, or notes that will help you to explain your work.
  - Remember you can export your flow-chart design directly from FigJam as a PNG graphic
  - You can also generate neatly formatted code snippets in FigJam using the code block tool under the 'More' tab of the 'Additional Tools' menu.
