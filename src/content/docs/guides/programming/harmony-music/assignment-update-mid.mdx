import MonsterReveal from "src/components/MonsterReveal.astro";

## Introduction

In this guide, we will update our assignment to reflect the latest changes to our project.

:::caution[Important - read first!]

## Progress check

So far, your assignment should have already documented the following:

- Breaking down the project requirements from the [client-brief](/code-monster/guides/programming/harmony-music/client-brief)
- Designed an [algorithm](/code-monster/guides/programming/harmony-music/algorithm-design) to handle the sign-up form logic
- Configured our [project file links](/code-monster/guides/programming/harmony-music/project-file-links) so they are ready for development
- Converted our algoritm into a [comment plan](/code-monster/guides/programming/harmony-music/comment-planning) for easier implementation
- Commited our changes to [GitHub](/code-monster/guides/programming/harmony-music/committing-to-github) for safekeeping

If you have not completed any of these steps, please [revisit the previous guide](/code-monster/guides/programming/harmony-music/assignment-update) and do so before continuing.

## Progress review

Since our last assignment update, we have:

- Configured [HTML inputs](/code-monster/guides/programming/harmony-music/html-inputs) so their values can be targetted in JavaScript
- Created an [event listener](/code-monster/guides/programming/harmony-music/capturing-form-data#the-documentqueryselector-and-addeventlistener-methods) to handle the form submission
- [Captured the data](/code-monster/guides/programming/harmony-music/capturing-form-data#targeting-input-values-in-javascript) coming from the form submission
- [Validated the form data](/code-monster/guides/programming/harmony-music/form-validation) to ensure it meets the required criteria
- Handled any [validation errors](/code-monster/guides/programming/harmony-music/error-handling) and displayed these neatly on the form

### Recording your work

- Make sure to document each step of your project in your assignment.
  - Think about how you can explain your work to someone who has never seen your project before.
  - Use clear language and avoid jargon where possible. Where you need to use technical terms, make sure to explain them.
  - Jusify the choices behind each step taken so far in the project.
- Include any code snippets, diagrams, or notes that will help you to explain your work.
  - Remember you can export your flow-chart design directly from FigJam as a PNG graphic
  - You can also generate neatly formatted code snippets in FigJam using the code block tool under the 'More' tab of the 'Additional Tools' menu.
