## Introduction

In this guide, we will update our assignment to reflect the latest changes to our project.

## Progress review

We've made some significant progress since our last update, including:

- Breaking down the project requirements from the [client-brief](/code-monter/guides/programming/harmony-music/client-brief)
- Designed an [algorithm](/code-monter/guides/programming/harmony-music/algorithm-design) to handle the sign-up form logic
- Configured our [project file links](/code-monter/guides/programming/harmony-music/project-file-links) so they are ready for development
- Converted our algoritm into a [comment plan](/code-monter/guides/programming/harmony-music/comment-planning) for easier implementation
- Commited our changes to [GitHub](/code-monter/guides/programming/harmony-music/committing-to-github) for safekeeping

### Recording your work

- Make sure to document each step of your project in your assignment.
  - Think about how you can explain your work to someone who has never seen your project before.
  - Use clear language and avoid jargon where possible. Where you need to use technical terms, make sure to explain them.
  - Jusify the choices behind each step taken so far in the project.
- Include any code snippets, diagrams, or notes that will help you to explain your work.
  - Remember you can export your flow-chart design directly from FigJam as a PNG graphic
  - You can also generate neatly formatted code snippets in FigJam using the code block tool under the 'More' tab of the 'Additional Tools' menu.
