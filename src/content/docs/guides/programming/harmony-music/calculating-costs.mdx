## Introduction

Now that we've validated the information coming through from the user, we can start calculating the costs for the customer.

We'll create a function that will take the user's input, calculate the final costs for the customer and then `return` an object that packages all this information together.

## Creating a new function

Let's start by creating a new function called `calculateCosts` that will take the user's input as an argument.

<Steps>

1. We will follow the same approach as before, and create a new JavaScript module (file) called `calculateCosts.js` to split our data into small, manageable chunks.

    ![Add calculate costs module](src/assets/webp/programming/harmony-music/add-calculate-costs-module.webp)

2. Inside this new file, add the code shown below:

    ```diff lang="javascript" title="calculateCosts.js" showLineNumbers
    +export function calculateCosts(data) {
    +  console.log('Calculating costs...');
    +  console.log({ data });
    +}
    ```

    :::note
    
    We've added the `console.log()` statements just to confirm that our function is being called correctly.

    :::

3. Now, we need to `import` this function into our main `index.js` file and call it with the user's input.

    ### Code Challenge - `import` and call `calculateCosts`

    Open `index.js`.

    1. Can you `import` the `calculateCosts` function into your `index.js` file?
    
    2. Can you call `calculateCosts` with the `result` object that is returned from our `validateForm()` function, but ***only if*** this data is valid?

    **TIPS:**
    - Think about the value that `result` is if the form data is invalid. What is this?
    - How could you use the value of `result` in an `if` statement to only call `calculateCosts` if the form data is valid?

    If everything works correctly, you should see the following in your browser console:
    
    - if the data is valid, you should see the message `Calculating costs...` and the `data` value in your broswer console
    - if the data is invalid, you should only see the value of `result` in your console

    ### Solution

    <MonsterReveal>

    Add the code highlighted below to your `index.js` file:

    ```diff lang="javascript" title="index.js" showLineNumbers collapse={8-15}
    +import { calculateCosts } from "./calculateCosts.js";
    import { validateForm } from "./validateForm.js";

    // Capture user's input on form submission
    let form = document.querySelector("form");

    form.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
      event.preventDefault();

      // Store the user's email address as userEmail (string/text)
      let userEmail = document.querySelector("#email").value;
      // Store the user's level as userLevel (string/text)
      let userLevel = document.querySelector("#level").value;
      // Store the user's hours of study as userHours (number)
      let userHours = parseInt(document.querySelector("#hoursPerWeek").value);

      // Validate the user's input
      const result = validateForm({ userEmail, userLevel, userHours });

      console.log({ result });

    +  if (result) {
    +    calculateCosts(result);
    +  }
    });
    // Calculate the total cost
    // Display the total cost to the user
    ```

    #### Explanation: Truthy and Falsy Values

    If the form data is invalid, the value of `result` will be `false`.

    An `if` statement is used to check if something is `true` or `false`.
    
    If validation fails on the form data, then `result` will be `false` and the `calculateCosts` function will not be called.

    However, if the form data is valid, then `result` will be an object containing the user's email, level and hours of study. In JavaScript, an object is considered `truthy` when considered in a boolean context, such as inbetween the brackets of an `if` statement.
    
    Therefore, the `if` statement will evaluate to `true` and the `calculateCosts` function will be called.

    See the MDN Web Docs for more information on [truthy and falsy values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy).

## Calculating Costs

Now that we have our function set up, we can start calculating the costs for the customer.

:::tip[Challenge]

### Code Challenge

Inside the `calculateCosts` function, implement the code that will calculate the total cost for the customer based on the `data` object values you have access to.

- Beginner lessons are £12.25 per hour; advanced lessons are £15.50.
- Use an object to store the following information:
  - The total cost of the lessons.
  - The user's email address.
  - How many hours the user is studying per week.
  - What level they are studying at (beginner or advanced)
- You should `return` this object from the `calculateCosts` function.
- You should capture the object that is returned from the `calculateCosts` function and call it `output`.
- Finally, `console.log` the `output` object.

**TIPS:**
- The total cost is the cost per hour multiplied by the number of hours the user is studying per week.
- The multiplication operator in JavaScript is `*`.

### Solution

<MonsterReveal>

<Steps>

1. Add the code highlighted below to your `calculateCosts.js` file:

    ```diff lang="javascript" title="calculateCosts.js" showLineNumbers collapse={}
    export function calculateCosts(data) {
    -  console.log('Calculating costs...');
    -  console.log({ data });

    +  const costPerHour = data.userLevel === 'beginner' ? 12.25 : 15.50;
    +  const totalCost = costPerHour * data.userHours;
    +
    +  const output = {
    +    totalCost,
    +    userEmail: data.userEmail,
    +    userHours: data.userHours,
    +    userLevel: data.userLevel,
    +  };
    +
    +  return output;
    }
    ```

2. Add the code highlighted below to your `index.js` file:

    ```diff lang="javascript" title="index.js" ins="const output = " showLineNumbers collapse={17-19}
    form.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
      event.preventDefault();

      // Store the user's email address as userEmail (string/text)
      let userEmail = document.querySelector("#email").value;
      // Store the user's level as userLevel (string/text)
      let userLevel = document.querySelector("#level").value;
      // Store the user's hours of study as userHours (number)
      let userHours = parseInt(document.querySelector("#hoursPerWeek").value);

      // Validate the user's input
      const result = validateForm({ userEmail, userLevel, userHours });

      if (result) {
        const output = calculateCosts(result);
    +    console.log({ output });
      }
    });
    ```

</Steps>
