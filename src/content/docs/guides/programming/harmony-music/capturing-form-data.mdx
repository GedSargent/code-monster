## Introduction

In this guide, we will learn how to capture input data from users and store it in variables.

This is a crucial step in building interactive web applications, as it allows you to collect information from users and use it to personalize their experience.

## Listening for a form submission event

Open the `index.js` file, and look carefully at the [comment plan](/code-monster/guides/programming/harmony-music/comment-planning) you created in the [previous guide](/code-monster/guides/programming/harmony-music/comment-planning).

We've already completed the first two steps - displaying the form to the user and including input fields for the user's email address, level, and hours of study.

We can go ahead and delete these two steps from our comment plan, as they are already covered in the HTML document that we've been working in:

```diff lang="javascript" title="index.js"
-// Display a form to the user
-// Include input fields for the user's email address, level, and hours of study
// Capture user's input on form submission
  // Store the user's email address as userEmail (string/text)
  // Store the user's level as userLevel (string/text)
  // Store the user's hours of study as userHours (number)
// Validate the user's input
  // Check if the user has selected a level
  // Check if the user has provided an email address
  // Check if the user has specified at least one hour of study
  // Check if the number of hours requested is within the allowed range
  // Calculate the total cost
// Display the total cost to the user
```

### The `document.querySelector()` and `addEventListener()` methods

When a user clicks the 'submit' button placed inside a HTML form, the `<form>` element itself fires a `submit` [event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events) to the browser.

We can use JavaScript to 'listen' for this event.

To do this, we need to:

1. Target the HTML form element as a variable in our code
2. Add an [event listener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#using_addeventlistener) to this variable.

Add the code below to your `index.js` file:

```diff lang="javascript" title="index.js" showLineNumbers collapse={8-16}
// Capture user's input on form submission
+let form = document.querySelector("form");
+
+form.addEventListener("submit", function () {
+  console.log("Form submitted");
+});
// Store the user's email address as userEmail (string/text)
// Store the user's level as userLevel (string/text)
// Store the user's hours of study as userHours (number)
// Validate the user's input
// Check if the user has selected a level
// Check if the user has provided an email address
// Check if the user has specified at least one hour of study
// Check if the number of hours requested is within the allowed range
// Calculate the total cost
// Display the total cost to the user
```

Take extra care to place this code directly below the comment note that describes it.

This will ensure that we cover each step of our plan as we implement its logic.

:::note[Code explanation]

### `document.querySelector()`

The `document.querySelector()` method is used to target an HTML element on the page, and store it as a variable in JavaScript

In this case, we are targeting the `"form"` element in the HTML document, and storing it as a variable called `form`.

```javascript mark='"form"'
let form = document.querySelector("form");
```

### `addEventListener()`

The `addEventListener()` method is used to "listen" for a specific event on an HTML element, and run a function when that event occurs:

```javascript {3-5}
let form = document.querySelector("form");

form.addEventListener("submit", function () {
  console.log("Form submitted");
});
```

### Callback functions

This function is just the same as any other in JavaScript, but within this particular context (i.e. inside an event listener), it is given a special name.

It is referred to as a ***callback*** function.

This is because it's code is "called back" into the logical flow of the application when the targeted event is triggered.
:::

## Checking execution flow with `console.log()`

You'll notice that within the body of this function we are only executing one line of code:

```javascript mark={2}
form.addEventListener("submit", function () {
  console.log("Form submitted");
});
```

The `console.log()` function is a quick way to print messsages to the browser console, or display the current values of variables as they change throughout your code.

We can just add anything we want to display in the browser console as an argument to it (i.e. between the two brackets).

In this case, we are simply printing a message to check that the callback function has indeed been triggered by form submission.

### Viewing the browser console

To view the console in your browser, right-click on the page and select `Inspect` from the context menu:

![Inspecting the page](src/assets/webp/programming/harmony-music/inspect-page.webp)

With the inspection panel open (this is also referred to as the "developer tools" panel), click on the `Console` tab:

![Console panel](src/assets/webp/programming/harmony-music/console-tab.webp)

Now, try submitting the form.

If all is working correctly, you should see the message `"Form submitted"` flash into the console, and then disappear.

![Form submit event default](src/assets/gif/programming/harmony-music/form-submit-event-default.gif)

## Using `event.preventDefault()` in event handlers

By default, when a form is submitted, the browser will automatically reload the page. This is because the form submission event is designed to send the form data to a server.

However, in our case, we want to capture the form data and use it to calculate the total cost of the user's lessons.

To prevent the page from reloading, we can use the `event.preventDefault()` method.

Looking ***carefully*** at the additions below, update your `index.js` code as follows:

```diff lang="javascript" title="index.js" showLineNumbers ins="(event)" collapse={9-17}
// Capture user's input on form submission
let form = document.querySelector("form");

form.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
+  event.preventDefault();
+
  console.log("Form submitted");
});
// Store the user's email address as userEmail (string/text)
// Store the user's level as userLevel (string/text)
// Store the user's hours of study as userHours (number)
// Validate the user's input
// Check if the user has selected a level
// Check if the user has provided an email address
// Check if the user has specified at least one hour of study
// Check if the number of hours requested is within the allowed range
// Calculate the total cost
// Display the total cost to the user
```

With this change in place, the page will no longer reload when the form is submitted, and your console message should remain visible:

![Form submit event with preventDefault()](src/assets/gif/programming/harmony-music/event-prevent-default.gif)

## Targeting input values in JavaScript

Let's go ahead and capture the user's email address.

Delete the `console.log();` message confirming the form is submitted, and add the lines highlighted in green to your `index.js` file:

```diff lang="javascript" name="index.js" showLineNumbers collapse={14-20}
// Capture user's input on form submission
let form = document.querySelector("form");

form.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
  event.preventDefault();

-  console.log("Form submitted");
+  // Store the user's email address as userEmail (string/text)
+  let userEmail = document.querySelector("#email").value;
+  console.log({ userEmail });
});
-// Store the user's email address as userEmail (string/text)
// Store the user's level as userLevel (string/text)
// Store the user's hours of study as userHours (number)
// Validate the user's input
// Check if the user has selected a level
// Check if the user has provided an email address
// Check if the user has specified at least one hour of study
// Check if the number of hours requested is within the allowed range
// Calculate the total cost
// Display the total cost to the user
```

### Checking the value of a variable - `console.log()`

As you will have noticed, we have a new `console.log()` statement that should print the value of the `userEmail` variable to the console.

We've also moved the relevent line from our comment plan above the variable to show where the `userEmail` is being captured.

Try submitting the form in your browser without anything written in the email field and check the developer tools console:

![Empty userEmail](src/assets/gif/programming/harmony-music/user-email-log-empty.gif)

:::caution

As you can see, even if the user does not write anything into a form field, the input element still sends the value of an ***empty*** string.

Remember this behaviour, as it will be important when we come to validate the user's input in a later step.

:::

Now try adding an email address and submitting the form again.

This time, you should see the email address you entered printed to the console:

![Filled userEmail](src/assets/webp/programming/harmony-music/user-email-log-filled.webp)

With this in place - it's your turn!

:::tip[Coding challenge]

## Challenge: User level and hours of study

1. Capture the user's *level* and *hours of study* in variables, the same way as we did for the email address. Give your variables suitable names that are consistent with our first variable name.
2. Print the values of these variables to the console.
3. Test your code by submitting the form with different values in the input fields.
4. Once your form is behaving correctly, move the relevant line from your comment plan above the respective variables.

{/* ### Solution

<MonsterReveal>

```diff lang="javascript" title="index.js" showLineNumbers ins=", userLevel, userHours" collapse={18-21}
// Capture user's input on form submission
let form = document.querySelector("form");

form.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  // Store the user's email address as userEmail (string/text)
  let userEmail = document.querySelector("#email").value;
+  // Store the user's level as userLevel (string/text)
+  let userLevel = document.querySelector("#level").value;
+  // Store the user's hours of study as userHours (number)
+  let userHours = document.querySelector("#hoursPerWeek").value;
  console.log({ userEmail, userLevel, userHours });
});
-// Store the user's level as userLevel (string/text)
-// Store the user's hours of study as userHours (number)
// Validate the user's input
// Check if the user has selected a level
// Check if the user has provided an email address
// Check if the user has specified at least one hour of study
// Check if the number of hours requested is within the allowed range
// Calculate the total cost
// Display the total cost to the user
```
