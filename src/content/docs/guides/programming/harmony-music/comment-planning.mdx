## Introduction

Now that you have your algorithm, it's time to transfer it into comment steps to help you code.

This is a crucial step in the coding process, as it helps you to translate your algorithm plan into small, manageable coding steps.

It can also help you to identify any potential issues or bugs in your algorithm before you start coding.

## Comment planning

### What are comments? What is a comment plan?

Comments are lines of text in your code that are not executed by the computer.

They are used to explain to humans what the code is doing, and why it is doing it.

For example:

```javascript
function toTitleCase(sentence) {
  // Split the sentence into an array of separate words
  let words = sentence.split(" ");
  
  // Loop through each word
  for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
    // Capitalize the first letter of each word
    words[i] = words[i][0].toUpperCase() + words[i].slice(1);
  }
  
  // Join the words back together
  let titleCasedSentence = words.join(" ");

  return titleCasedSentence;
}
```

In the example above, the comments explain what each part of the code is doing. This makes it easier for other developers (or yourself, in the future) to understand the code.

A comment plan is a list of comments that describe the steps you need to take to code your algorithm.

## How to create a comment plan

Let's take the algorithm we created in the previous guide as an example:

![Sign-up logic flowchart](src/assets/png/programming/harmony-music-sign-up-logic.png)

Immediately, we can see that we need to:

1. Display a form to the user
2. Include input fields for the user's email address, level, and hours of study
3. Capture user's input on form submission
4. Validate the user's input
5. Calculate the total cost
6. Display the total cost to the user

Already, these steps provide a good starting point for our comment plan. Let's add them to the `index.js` file:

```javascript title="index.js"
// Display a form to the user
// Include input fields for the user's email address, level, and hours of study
// Capture user's input on form submission
// Validate the user's input
// Calculate the total cost
// Display the total cost to the user
```

Some of these steps need breaking down even further. 

For example, "Capture user's input on form submission" could be broken down into:

```javascript title="index.js"
// Display a form to the user
// Include input fields for the user's email address, level, and hours of study
// Capture user's input on form submission
  // Get the user's email address
  // Get the user's level
  // Get the user's hours of study
```

For example, "Validate the user's input" could be broken down into:

```javascript title="index.js"
// Display a form to the user
// Include input fields for the user's email address, level, and hours of study
// Capture user's input on form submission
// Validate the user's input
  // Check if the user has selected a level
  // Check if the user has provided an email address
  // Check if the user has specified at least one hour of study
  // Check if the number of hours requested is within the allowed range
  // Calculate the total cost
// Display the total cost to the user

```

### Challenge: input types

For each of the input fields, consider what type of input they should accept. For example, the email address field could be stored in the variable name `userEmail`, and should be a data type of 'string'.

Using the same technique as above, add comments to your `index.js` file that describe the variable name you will store each input field as, and the type of input each field should accept.

#### Solution

<MonsterReveal>

```diff lang="javascript" title="index.js" showLineNumbers
// Display a form to the user
// Include input fields for the user's email address, level, and hours of study
// Capture user's input on form submission
+  // Store the user's email address as userEmail (string/text)
+  // Store the user's level as userLevel (string/text)
+  // Store the user's hours of study as userHours (number)
// Capture user's input on form submission
// Validate the user's input
  // Check if the user has selected a level
  // Check if the user has provided an email address
  // Check if the user has specified at least one hour of study
  // Check if the number of hours requested is within the allowed range
  // Calculate the total cost
// Display the total cost to the user
```

## Summary

In this guide, we've introduced the concept of comment planning and how it can help you to translate your algorithm into coding steps.

We've shown how to create a comment plan for your project, and how to break down each step into smaller, more manageable tasks.

## Next steps

In the next guide, we'll look at how to actually capture the user's input on form submission, and how to store this data in variables for use in our code.
