## Introduction

Now that you've made some changes to your code, it's time to commit them to GitHub.

Committing your changes is an essential part of the coding process, as it allows you to save your work and keep track of the changes you've made.

In this guide, you will learn how to commit your code changes to GitHub using Github Desktop.

## Committing your changes

### Step 1: Open Github Desktop

Open Github Desktop on your computer.

If you are not already authenticated, you will need to sign in using your GitHub account.

Check you are in the correct project by examining the 'Current repository' dropdown in the top left corner.

### Step 2: Review your changes

Before committing your changes, it's a good idea to review them.

1. You can do this by clicking on the 'Changes' tab in Github Desktop (if it is not already selected).

2. Directly beneath the 'Changes' tab, you will see a list of all the files that have been modified

When you click on a file, you will see a side-by-side comparison of the changes you've made in the large panel on the right.

Lines highlighted in green represent new code that has been added.

Lines highlighted in red represent code that has been removed.

#### Check for errors

This is an important step to ensure that you have not introduced any errors into your code.

Don't rush it!

Look through each file *carefully* and make sure that all of the changes you've made are correct.

### Step 3: Commit your changes

Once you are happy with the changes you've made, it's time to commit them.

1. In the 'Summary' field to the bottom left of the screen, write a ***brief*** description of the changes you've made.

    *e.g. "Link HTML, CSS and JS files", "Capture user input", "Add event listeners"*

2. In the 'Description' field, you can provide more detailed information about the changes if you wish.

3. Click the 'Commit to main' button to commit your changes.

### Step 4: Push your changes to GitHub

After a few moments, your changes will disappear and the large right-hand panel will be replaced with various options for the project.

Your changes have now been 'committed' to Git. You will need to push them to GitHub.

Click the 'Push origin' button in the top right panel of the screen.

### Step 5: Verify your changes on GitHub

Once you have pushed your changes to GitHub, you can verify that they have been successfully uploaded by visiting your repository on GitHub.

The quickest way to do this is to click the 'View on GitHub' button in the right panel of the screen.

### Updating your assignment

Over the previous guides, we made a lot of changes to our project.

It is essential to keep your assignment up to date with the changes you've made.

Revisit the pages we have covered so far to remind yourself of the changes you've made.

Head back to OneNote and look carefully at the requirements for the assignment, then record what changes you have made and why.
