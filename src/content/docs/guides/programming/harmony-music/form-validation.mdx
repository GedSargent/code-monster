## Introduction

The first rule of web development is simple: never trust any user input.

This is because users can enter anything they want into a form field, and it's up to you to make sure that the data is valid and safe to use.

This tutorial will walk you through how to validate user input in a sign-up form for Harmony Music Academy.

## 1. Presence checking

The simplest form of validation is to check if a field is empty or not. This is known as ***presence checking***.

In our sign-up form, we want to make sure that the user has entered their email address, level, and hours per week.

### Checking for empty fields

Let's start by seeing what happens when we submit the form without entering any data.


<Steps>

1. If you have been following the steps in the previous tutorial on [Capturing Form Data](/code-monster/guides/programming/harmony-music/capturing-form-data), you should already have the following code inside your `index.js` file:

    ```js title="index.js" showLineNumbers {7-10} collapse={13-21}
    // Capture user's input on form submission
    let form = document.querySelector("form");

    form.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
      event.preventDefault();

      let userEmail = document.querySelector("#email").value;
      let userLevel = document.querySelector("#level").value;
      let userHours = document.querySelector("#hoursPerWeek").value;
      console.log({ userEmail, userLevel, userHours });
    });
    // Store the user's email address as userEmail (string/text)
    // Store the user's level as userLevel (string/text)
    // Store the user's hours of study as userHours (number)
    // Validate the user's input
    // Check if the user has selected a level
    // Check if the user has provided an email address
    // Check if the user has specified at least one hour of study
    // Check if the number of hours requested is within the allowed range
    // Calculate the total cost
    // Display the total cost to the user
    ```

2. With this code in place, start your application server in the [usual way](https://github.com/L4-Programming/harmony-music?tab=readme-ov-file#4-view-html-in-browser).

3. In your browser, open up the dev tools, and navigate to the 'Console' tab.

4. Submit the form without entering any data. You should see the following output in the console:

    ![logging-empty-form-values](src/assets/gif/programming/harmony-music/logging-empty-form-values.gif)

    As you can see, the `userEmail` and `userHours` values are empty strings, while `userLevel` is string that reads `'basic'`.

    ```js
    { userEmail: "", userLevel: "basic", userHours: "" }
    ```

</Steps>

Let's spend a moment to understand where these values are coming from.

::::note

### Types of HTML input fields

#### 1. Text inputs

<Steps>

1. Open your `index.html` file and locate the form field for the user's email address.

    It should be somewhere around line 17, and look like this:

    ```html title='index.html' {4}
    <input
      id="email"
      name="email"
      type="text"
      class="form-input"
      placeholder="Your email"
    />
    ```

    The highlighted line above shows field is of type `text`, which means that it accepts any kind of text input from the user.

2. When we submit the form, the `value` of the text box is captured in the `userEmail` variable:

    ```js
    let userEmail = document.querySelector("#email").value;
    ```

3. If the user does not enter anything in the text box, the `value` of the text box will simply be an empty string `""`.

    :::caution[Tip]
    Keep this value in mind, as we can use it to check whether a user has actually submitted an email address later.
    :::

</Steps>

#### 2. Select boxes

<Steps>

1. Head back to your `index.html` file and locate the select box for the user's level.

    It should be around line 27, and look like this:

    ```html title='index.html' {2-4}
    <select id="level" name="level" class="form-input">
      <option value="basic">Basic</option>
      <option value="intermediate">Intermediate</option>
      <option value="advanced">Advanced</option>
    </select>
    ```

2. The highlighted lines above show the three options that a user can choose from.

    If you look closely, you'll see that every `option` tag has a `value` attribute that corresponds to the level name.

    It is this `value` that is captured in the `userLevel` variable (inside `index.js`) when the form is submitted:

    ```js title='index.js'
    let userLevel = document.querySelector("#level").value;
    ```

3. If the user does not select any option, the `value` of the select box will be the `value` of the first option, which is `'basic'`.

</Steps>

### Checking for empty fields

Now that we know where our form values are coming from, let's think how we can add a validation check that ensures that the user has entered an email address.

<Steps>

1. Inside `index.js`, just above the `console.log()` statement, add a conditional check like so:

    ```diff lang="js" title='index.js'
    // Capture user's input on form submission
    let form = document.querySelector("form");

    form.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
      event.preventDefault();

      let userLevel = document.querySelector("#level").value;
      let userEmail = document.querySelector("#email").value;
      let userHours = document.querySelector("#hoursPerWeek").value;
    +
    +  if (userEmail === "") {
    +    alert("Please enter your email address.");
    +
    +    return;
    +  }
    +
      console.log({ userEmail, userLevel, userHours });
    });
    ```

2. Save your changes, and head back over to your browser.

    Make sure your devtools console is still open, and try submitting an empty form again.

    This time, you should see an alert message that says "Please enter your email address."

    ![alert-empty-email](src/assets/gif/programming/harmony-music/alert-empty-email.gif)

3. Did you notice something else as well? The `console.log()` statement is no longer executed when the email field is empty.

    Can you work out why?

    <MonsterReveal>

    This is because the `return` statement inside the `if` block stops the function from executing any further.

    ```js {4}
    if (userEmail === "") {
      alert("Please enter your email address.");

      return;
    }
    ```

    Any time you see a `return` statement inside a function, it means that the function will stop executing the code inside it at that point and `return` whatever value we have told it to.
    
    (In this case, the function returns `undefined`, because we haven't specified a value to return.)

    Because of this, the `console.log()` statement is never reached when the email field is empty.

    This behaviour is useful because it allows us to stop the computer processing data unnecessarily if any of the fields are empty.

    </MonsterReveal>

4. Now that we have a check in place for the email field, let's add similar ones to validate the other form fields.

    :::tip[Challenge]

    Can you add checks to ensure that the `userHours` field is not submitted as an empty string? ðŸ¤”

    #### Expected behaviour

    - If the user has submitted an empty string for `userHours`, display an alert message to prompt them to enter the required information.
    - The function should not continue to log the form data to the console if either `userEmail` or `userHours` are empty.
    - If there are values for each of the fields, the form data should be logged to the console as before.

    ### Solution

    <MonsterReveal>
  
    To add a check for the `userHours` field, you can follow the same pattern as the check for the `userEmail` field.

    ```diff lang="js" title="index.js" showLineNumbers collapse={24-33}
    // Capture user's input on form submission
    let form = document.querySelector("form");

    form.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
      event.preventDefault();

      let userEmail = document.querySelector("#email").value;
      let userLevel = document.querySelector("#level").value;
      let userHours = document.querySelector("#hoursPerWeek").value;

      if (userEmail === "") {
        alert("Please enter your email address.");

        return;
      }
    +  if (userHours === "") {
    +    alert("Please how many hours of tuition you would like.");
    +
    +    return;
    +  }

      console.log({ userEmail, userLevel, userHours });
    });
    // Store the user's email address as userEmail (string/text)
    // Store the user's level as userLevel (string/text)
    // Store the user's hours of study as userHours (number)
    // Validate the user's input
    // Check if the user has selected a level
    // Check if the user has provided an email address
    // Check if the user has specified at least one hour of study
    // Check if the number of hours requested is within the allowed range
    // Calculate the total cost
    // Display the total cost to the user
    ```
    </MonsterReveal>

  </Steps>

## 2. Content validation

Presence checking is one thing, but we also need to make sure that the data entered by the user is valid.

Let's start by checking if the user has entered a valid email address.

### Checking for valid email addresses

This is actually surprising easy!

<Steps>

1. Open `index.html`

2. Locate the input field for the user's email address.

    It should be around line 17, and look like this:

    ```html title='index.html' {4}
    <input
      id="email"
      name="email"
      type="text"
      class="form-input"
      placeholder="Your email"
    />
    ```

3. The `type` attribute of the input field is set to `text`, which means that it accepts any kind of text input.

    All we need to do is change this to `email`:

    ```html title='index.html' ins='type="email"'
    <input
      id="email"
      name="email"
      type="email"
      class="form-input"
      placeholder="Your email"
    />
    ```

4. With this in place, if you submit a value in the email field that is not a valid email address, the browser will automatically display an error message.

    ![Email content validation](src/assets/webp/programming/harmony-music/email-content-validation.webp)

</Steps>

### Checking for valid hours

One simple check that we need to do is ensure that users must enter a positive integer for the number of hours.

<Steps>

1. Open `index.js`

2. Before we can check if the number is positive or not, we need to convert the value of `userHours` to a number.

    This is because the `value` of an input field is always a string, even if the HTML input field is of type `number`.

    To convert the value to a number, we can use the built-in JavaScript `parseInt()` function.

    Remove the line highlighted in red below, and replace it with the code highlighted in green:

    ```diff lang="js" title='index.js' showLineNumbers collapse={10-21}
    form.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
      event.preventDefault();

      let userEmail = document.querySelector("#email").value;
      let userLevel = document.querySelector("#level").value;
      let userHours = document.querySelector("#hoursPerWeek").value;
    -  let userHours = document.querySelector("#hoursPerWeek").value;
    +  let userHours = parseInt(document.querySelector("#hoursPerWeek").value);
      
      if (userEmail === "") {
        alert("Please enter your email address.");

        return;
      }
      if (userHours === "") {
        alert("Please how many hours of tuition you would like.");

        return;
      }

      console.log({ userEmail, userLevel, userHours });
    });
    ```

2. Now we can do a check on the actual number value.

    Just below the check for an empty `userHours` field, add a second `if` condition to ensure that the value is at least 1 or above:

    ```diff lang="js" title='index.js' showLineNumbers collapse={5-15, 29-38}
    // Capture user's input on form submission
    let form = document.querySelector("form");

    form.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
      event.preventDefault();

      let userEmail = document.querySelector("#email").value;
      let userLevel = document.querySelector("#level").value;
      let userHours = parseInt(document.querySelector("#hoursPerWeek").value);

      if (userEmail === "") {
        alert("Please enter your email address.");

        return;
      }
      if (userHours === "") {
        alert("Please how many hours of tuition you would like.");

        return;
      }
    +  if (userHours < 1) {
    +    alert("Please enter at least one hour of tuition.");
    +
    +    return;
    +  }

      console.log({ userEmail, userLevel, userHours });
    });
    // Store the user's email address as userEmail (string/text)
    // Store the user's level as userLevel (string/text)
    // Store the user's hours of study as userHours (number)
    // Validate the user's input
    // Check if the user has selected a level
    // Check if the user has provided an email address
    // Check if the user has specified at least one hour of study
    // Check if the number of hours requested is within the allowed range
    // Calculate the total cost
    // Display the total cost to the user
    ```

</Steps>

## Validation checklist

With the work completed so far, you have a good foundation for validating user input in your form.

Here's two more validation checks you should consider adding:

- Has the user selected a valid level (`"basic"`, `"intermediate"`, `"advanced"`)?
- Is the number of hours requested within the allowed range for the level they have chosen (e.g., between 1 and 10 hours)?

:::tip[Challenge]

Can you add these two checks to your form validation code?

Are there any other validation checks that you identified while planning your logic algorithm?

#### Expected behaviour

- If any validation check fails, display an alert message to prompt the user to enter the required information.
- The function should not continue to log the form data to the console if any of the validation checks fail.
- If all validation checks pass, the form data should be logged to the console as before.

## Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to validate user input in a sign-up form for Harmony Music Academy.

We have covered:

- Presence checking to ensure that the user has entered data in all required fields.
- Content validation to ensure that the data entered is of the correct type and format.
- Using a `return` statement to stop the function from executing if any validation check fails.

## Next steps

In the next step, we will learn how to optimise the error messages shown to users when they fail to complete the required information.
