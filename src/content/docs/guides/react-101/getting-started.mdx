## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

The web framework we will be using to develop your app is called Remix, and it is built on top of React. It therefore makes sense to learn the basics of React first.

## Why use React?

React is a popular library for building user interfaces because it is:

#### 📝 **Declarative**
React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

#### 🧩 **Component-Based**
Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

#### 🌍 **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**
We don't have to learn a new language or framework to use React. It is just JavaScript.

## Installing your starter project

To get started, we will use a starter project that has been set up for you. This project includes all the necessary configuration and dependencies to get you started with React and Remix.

Head to **OneNote > Modern Web Apps > 01 React, Remix and Tailwind**. You will see a link to the Github Classroom starter project to click on and get started.

Once you have set the project up, you can run the following commands to start the project:

```bash
npm install
```

Wait for the installation to complete, then run:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This will set up the project database for you.

Finally, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once you have your dev server running, come back here to continue with the next steps. We will start by learning about React components and props.
