## What are React components?

Components are the building blocks of a React application.

A component is a reusable piece of code that defines how a part of the user interface should look and behave. Components can be nested inside other components to create complex user interfaces.

In React, components can be created using functions. These are called, unsurprisingly enough, "functional components". Here's an example of a simple functional component:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>
}
```

When this component is rendered, it will display a `<h1>` element with the text "Hello".

## Embedding components

Of course, you can render this component in another component like this:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>
}

function UserProfile() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting />
    </div>
  )
}
```

When `UserProfile` is rendered, it will display a `<div>` element containing the `<Greeting>` component.

## Rendering images

Components can also render images. Here's an example of a component that renders an image:

```jsx
function Avatar() {
  return <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="Avatar" />
}
```

When this component is rendered, it will display an `<img>` element with the specified `src` and `alt` attributes.

This image takes as its source a URL from [placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/). This is a service that provides placeholder images for use in web development.

## Importing images

However, most of the time you would want to import images from your project's `assets` folder.

You can do this by importing the image and using it as the `src` attribute of the `<img>` element. If we take the same example as above, but with an image imported from the `assets` folder:

```jsx
import avatar from './assets/avatar.png'

function Avatar() {
  return <img src={avatar} alt="Avatar" />
}
```

:::note[Expression slots in JSX]

### Understanding expression slots

Those curly braces in `<img src={avatar} alt="Avatar" />` can be thought of as [expression slots in JSX](https://react.dev/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces#using-curly-braces-a-window-into-the-javascript-world). They allow you to embed JavaScript [expressions (code that produces a value)](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/javascript/statements-vs-expressions/) inside JSX.

### Where to use curly braces

You can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX:

1. As text directly inside a JSX tag: `<h1>{name}'s To Do List</h1>` works, but `<{tag}>Gregorio Y. Zara's To Do List</{tag}>` will not.
2. As attributes immediately following the `=` sign: `src={avatar}` will read the avatar variable, but `src="{avatar}"` will pass the string `"{avatar}"`.

#### Learn more

These examples were all taken from the React documentation on [embedding expressions in JSX](https://react.dev/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces), and this page is a great resource to learn more about this topic.
