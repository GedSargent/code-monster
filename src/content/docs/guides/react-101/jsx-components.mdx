## What are React components?

Components are the building blocks of a React application.

A component is a reusable piece of code that describes how a part of the user interface (UI) should look and behave.

Components can be nested inside other components to create complex user interfaces.

In React, it is best to create components using [**functions**](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-function/). These are called, unsurprisingly enough, [**"functional components"**](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component#defining-a-component).

Here's an example of a simple functional component:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>
}
```

When this component is rendered, it will display a `<h1>` element with the text "Hello".

## Embedding components

You can render this component in another component like this:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>
}

function ProfileRoute() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting />
    </div>
  )
}
```

When `UserProfile` is rendered, it will display a `<div>` element containing the `<Greeting>` component.

## Rendering images

Components can also render images. Here's an example of a component that renders an image:

```jsx
function Avatar() {
  return <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="Avatar" />
}
```

When this component is rendered, it will display an `<img>` element with the specified `src` and `alt` attributes.

This image takes as its source a URL from [**placeholder.com**](https://placeholder.com/). This is a service that provides placeholder images for use in web development.

## Importing images

However, most of the time you would want to import images from your project's `assets` folder.

You can do this by importing the image, storing its path as a variable, then finally using it as the `src` attribute of the `<img>` element.

If we take the same example as above, but with an image imported from the `assets` folder:

```jsx
import avatar from './assets/avatar.png'

function Avatar() {
  return <img src={avatar} alt="Avatar" />
}
```

:::note[Expression slots in JSX]

### Understanding expression slots

Those curly braces in `<img src={avatar} alt="Avatar" />` can be thought of as [expression slots in JSX](https://react.dev/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces#using-curly-braces-a-window-into-the-javascript-world). They allow you to embed JavaScript [expressions (code that produces a value)](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/javascript/statements-vs-expressions/) inside JSX.

### Where to use curly braces

You can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX:

1. As text directly inside a JSX tag: `<h1>{name}'s To Do List</h1>` works, but `<{tag}>Gregorio Y. Zara's To Do List</{tag}>` will not.
2. As attributes immediately following the `=` sign: `src={avatar}` will read the avatar variable, but `src="{avatar}"` will pass the string `"{avatar}"`.

#### Learn more

These examples were all taken from the React documentation on [embedding expressions in JSX](https://react.dev/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces), and this page is a great resource to learn more about this topic.

## Challenges

::::tip[Practicing with components]

Make sure your server is running by typing the command below into your terminal and hitting 'Enter':

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 1. Create a new page in Remix

- Create a new page in Remix with the route `/profiles` that simply renders a `<h1>` element with the text "Profiles". The title should be large, bold and centered.
- Use the starter code below to get going:

```tsx title="routes/profiles.tsx"
export default function ProfilesRoute() {
	return (
		<div className="min-h-screen p-16">
			<div>
        {/* Replace this comment with your code here */}
			</div>
		</div>
	)
}
```
- Your page should look like this in the browser:

![Profiles page](/src/assets/png/components/profiles-page.png)

### 2. Create a new component

- At the top of your `routes/profiles.tsx` file, Create a new component called `ProfileCard` that renders the following:
  - a `<h4>` element with the text "User's Name".
  - a `<p>` element with the text "User's Bio".
- Embed this component in the `/profile` page, just below your `<h1>` element.
- Your page should now look like this in the browser:

![Greeting component start](/src/assets/png/components/greeting-component-start.png)

### 3. Add an image

1. Find and download a profile image from [**pexels.com**](https://www.pexels.com/search/face/?orientation=square).
2. Save the image into the `assets` folder of your Remix project.
3. Using a JavaScript `import` statement, import the image to the top of your `profile.tsx` page.

:::note

Remind yourself how to import images in React by revisiting the [**section above**](#importing-images).

:::

4. Update your `Greeting` component to render the image you imported in step 3. The image should have an `alt` attribute with the value "Profile Image".

### 4. Style your component

Using Tailwind CSS, style your component so that it looks like the image below:

![Greeting component finish](/src/assets/png/components/greeting-component-finish.png)

## Solution

Watch the video below to see how I solved the challenges:

Once you have your component set up, you can move on to the next section.
