## What are props?

At the moment, our `ProfileCard` component looks great, but it is **static**.

It always displays the same information, no matter when it's used.

This is not very useful. We want to be able to pass different data to the `ProfileCard` component so that it can display different profiles.

Props are a way to pass data to components in React. They are similar to arguments in functions. You can pass any data type to a component as a prop, including strings, numbers, arrays, objects, and functions.

## Passing props to components

Let's start with our simple `Greeting` component from the [**previous session**](/code-monster/guides/react-101/jsx-components):

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>
}
```

Like our `ProfileCard` component, this component is **static**. It always displays the same greeting. Let's make it dynamic by passing a `name` prop to it.

### The `props` object

When you pass a prop to a component, React stores it in a special object called `props`.

With functional components, you can access the `props` object as an argument to the component function.

Here's how you can pass a `name` prop to the `Greeting` component:

```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
}
```

Notice that we added a `name` prop to the `Greeting` component? We can now use the `Greeting` component like this:

Now, you can use the `Greeting` component like this:

```jsx
<Greeting name="Alice" /> // Hello, Alice
<Greeting name="Bob" /> // Hello, Bob
<Greeting name="Charlie" /> // Hello, Charlie
```

### What happens if you don't pass a prop that is expected?

If you don't pass a prop to a component that is expecting one, React will just set the value of the prop to `undefined`.

For example, if you use the `Greeting` component above without a prop, look what happens:

```jsx
<Greeting />  // Hello, undefined
<Greeting />  // Hello, undefined
<Greeting />  // Hello, undefined
```

It is for this reason that Typescript is recommended for React projects.

### Typescript and interfaces

With Typescript, we can define something called an interface to define the shape of the props that a component expects.

Let's modify the `Greeting` component to use an interface to define the shape of the props it expects:

```diff lang="tsx" ins=": GreetingProps"
+interface GreetingProps {
+  name: string
+}
+
function Greeting(props: GreetingProps) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
}
```

### Destructuring props

In the `Greeting` component, we used the `props` object to access the `name` prop. This is a common pattern in React.

To make the code cleaner, you can use [**destructuring**](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/destructuring-function-parameters-d110c59d7b8c) to extract the `name` prop from the `props` object:

```diff lang="tsx" ins="{ name }"
interface GreetingProps {
  name: string
}


function Greeting({ name }: GreetingProps) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
}
```

Because we used destructuring to extract the `name` prop from the `props` object here, we can now access the `name` prop directly without write `props` before it.

## Passing multiple props

You can pass multiple props to a component. Here's an example:

```jsx
function UserCard(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{props.name}</h1>
      <p>{props.bio}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

You can use the `UserCard` component like this:

```jsx
<UserCard name="Alice" bio="Frontend developer" />
<UserCard name="Bob" bio="Backend developer" />
<UserCard name="Charlie" bio="Fullstack developer" />
```

Refer back to this guide when working on the challenges below.

## Challenges

:::tip[Add props to a component]

### 1. Update the `ProfileCard` component to accept a `name` prop.

The `ProfileCard` component should display the name of the profile passed to it. When finished, this means you can use the `ProfileCard` component like this:

```tsx title="routes/profiles.tsx"
<div>
  <ProfileCard name="Alice Smith" />
  <ProfileCard name="Bob Everett" />
  <ProfileCard name="Charlie Jones" />
</div>
```

### 2. Add an `image` prop.

Update the `ProfileCard` component to accept an `image` prop. The `image` prop should be the URL of an image to display in the profile card.

When finished, you should be able to use the `ProfileCard` component like this:

```tsx title="routes/profiles.tsx"
import alicePic from "~/assets/jpg/alice.jpg"
import bobPic from "~/assets/jpg/bob.jpg"
import charliePic from "~/assets/jpg/charlie.jpg"

<div>
  <ProfileCard name="Alice Smith" image={alicePic} />
  <ProfileCard name="Bob Everett" image={bobPic} />
  <ProfileCard name="Charlie Jones" image={charliePic} />
</div>
```

Your final page should look something like this:
