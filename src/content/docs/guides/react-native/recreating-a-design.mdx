In this guide, we'll use React Native to recreate the design for a single todo item from Figma.

## 1. Consider the design

The first step in recreating a design is to consider the design itself.

With a partner, look carefully at the design below:

![Design for incomplete todo item](src/assets/svg/react-native/incomplete-todo-design.svg)

:::tip[Challenge]

Decide on the following:

- what styles you would apply to each component:
  - what colours will you need?
  - what size fonts?
  - what padding and margins?
- breaking down `View` and `Text` components:
  - what would be the parent `View` component?
  - what would be the child `View` components?
  - what would be the `Text` components?

### - Styles and colours

We can lift things like colour, font and text size directly from Figma.

For example, just select a text element and copy the colour code from the 'Fill' field.

![Viewing design attributes in Figma](src/assets/webp/react-native/viewing-design-attributes.webp)

As you can see, the font family, size, weight, line-height and alignment are all available as well.

### - Padding and margins

In a similar way, we can measure the padding and margins of elements in Figma.

Click on the element in your layers panel and, if this is an autolayout frame, you can see the padding and margin values on the right of your screen.

### - View and Text components

Here again, Figma can help. Broadly speaking, each frame in Figma can be thought of as a `View` component in React Native.

Look at how the design below can be broken down into three `View` components:

![View and Text components in Figma](src/assets/svg/react-native/incomplete-todo-design-with-components.svg)

Here we have:

- a main parent (outlined in blue)
- a child component for the checkbox (outlined in pink)
- a child component for the text (outlined in green)

</MonsterReveal>

## 2. Create the components

With this structure in mind, let's take a look at how we might build the component in React Native code.

<Steps>

1. Open the project in your code editor and run the app with the command below:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2. Decide if you want to see the app on your phone or in the browser by following the instructions in your terminal.

3. Open `app/index.tsx` and replace all the code inside with the following:

    ```jsx title="app/index.tsx"
    import { View, Text } from "react-native";

    export default function HomeScreen() {
      return (
        <View className="flex flex-1 py-32 bg-background">
          <Text className="text-white text-center">Hello, world!</Text>
        </View>
      );
    }
    ```

    This gives us a simple `View` component with a `Text` component inside it:

    ![Todo screen 1](src/assets/webp/react-native/todo-01.webp)

4. Remind yourself how we said the component structure might look:

    ![View and Text components in Figma](src/assets/svg/react-native/incomplete-todo-design-with-components.svg)

    To recreate this, I'm going to:
      - delete the 'Hello, world!' placeholder text
      - create a parent `View` component and give it an articfical height and border so that it matches the outlines above:

    ```diff lang="jsx" title="app/index.tsx"
    import { View, Text } from "react-native";

    export default function HomeScreen() {
      return (
        <View className="flex flex-1 py-32 bg-background">
    -      <Text className="text-white text-center">Hello, world!</Text>
    +      <View className="h-20 w-full border-2 border-cyan-400"></View>
        </View>
      );
    }
    ```

    ![Todo screen 2](src/assets/webp/react-native/todo-02.webp)

5. Next, I'll add two `View` components inside the parent, and give these temporary borders that match the plan above:

    ```diff lang="jsx" title="app/index.tsx"
    import { Text, View } from "react-native";

    export default function HomeScreen() {
      return (
        <View className="flex flex-1 py-32 bg-background">
          <View className="flex flex-row h-20 w-full border-2 border-cyan-400">
    +        <View className="flex w-24 h-full border-2 border-pink-400"></View>
    +        <View className="flex flex-1 h-full border-2 border-green-400">
    +
    +        </View>
          </View>
        </View>
      );
    }
    ```

    ![Todo screen 3](src/assets/webp/react-native/todo-03.webp)
  
6. Let's add some text inside the green `View` component:

    ```diff lang="jsx" title="app/index.tsx"
    import { Text, View } from "react-native";

    export default function HomeScreen() {
      return (
        <View className="flex flex-1 py-32 bg-background">
          <View className="flex flex-row h-20 w-full border-2 border-cyan-400">
            <View className="flex w-24 h-full border-2 border-pink-400">
    +          <Text className="text-foreground">Feed the cat</Text>
            </View>
          </View>
        </View>
      );
    }
    ```

    ![Todo screen 4](src/assets/webp/react-native/todo-04.webp)

</Steps>

## 3. Style the todo item

1. Style the text inside the green `View` component to match the design. You will need to think about:
    - the font size
    - the font colours (tip - use the `text-foreground` and `text-foreground-transparent` classes)

2. Add a checkbox in the pink `View` component. You will need to install and use the `checkbox` component from `React Native Reusables'.
    - Research how to install and use this by following the [documentation](https://rnr-docs.vercel.app/components/checkbox/).

3. Remove the placeholder borders from the `View` components and style them to match the design. You will need to think about:
    - the border along the bottom of the todo item (tip - use the `border-b` and `border-foreground-transparent` classes where you feel is correct)
    - the padding and margins

Your final implementation should look and behave something like this:

  <source src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dptdx8zuv/video/upload/v1741728506/05-todo_dxvp8n.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
