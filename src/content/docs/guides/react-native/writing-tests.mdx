import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Here's a simple step-by-step guide to help you write your first tests for the Hall Pass application.

## Step 1: Install Required Packages

Open your terminal in the project directory and run:

```bash
npm install --save-dev react-test-renderer@18.2.0 @testing-library/react-native@12.3.0 babel-plugin-module-resolver
```

:::note[What are these packages?]
<Steps>
1. **@testing-library/react-native**: A testing utility that helps you test React Native components in a way that resembles how users interact with your app
2. **react-test-renderer**: Required as a peer dependency for React Native Testing Library
3. **babel-plugin-module-resolver**: Helps resolve path aliases (like `~/components`) in your tests
</Steps>
:::

## Step 2: Configure Jest

Create a Jest configuration file called `jest.config.js` in the root of your project.

<FileTree>
- global.css
- index.js
- **jest.config.js**
- metro.config
- nativewind-env.d.ts
</FileTree>

This file allows you to customize how tests are run by adding the code below:

```js title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  preset: "react-native",
  moduleFileExtensions: ["ts", "tsx", "js", "jsx", "json", "node"],
  testMatch: ["**/tests/**/*.test.js"],
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "^~/(.*)": "<rootDir>/$1",
  },
  transformIgnorePatterns: [
    "node_modules/(?!(react-native|@react-native|@rn-primitives|react-native-.*)/)",
  ],
};
```

:::note[Understanding the Jest Configuration]
<Steps>
1. `preset: "react-native"` - Uses the React Native preset for Jest, which includes transformers for React Native code
2. `moduleFileExtensions` - Specifies which file extensions Jest should look for
3. `testMatch` - Tells Jest where to find test files (in this case, any .test.js file in the tests directory)
4. `moduleNameMapper` - Maps the `~/` path alias to the root directory, allowing imports like `import Component from '~/components/Component'`
5. `transformIgnorePatterns` - Tells Jest which node_modules to transform (React Native modules need to be transformed)
</Steps>
:::

## Step 3: Update package.json

Add a test script and Jest configuration to your `package.json` file:

```diff lang="json" title="package.json" showLineNumbers collapse={9-14, 17-51}
{
  "name": "hall-pass",
  "main": "index.js",
  "version": "1.0.0",

    "dev:android": "expo start -c --android",
    "android": "expo start -c --android",
    "ios": "expo start -c --ios",
    "web": "expo start -c --web",
    "clean": "rm -rf .expo node_modules",
    "postinstall": "npx tailwindcss -i ./global.css -o ./node_modules/.cache/nativewind/global.css"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^2.1.2",

  },
  "devDependencies": {

  "private": true,
+  "jest": {
+    "preset": "react-native",
+    "testsMatch": [
+      "**/tests/**/*.test.js"
+    ]
+  }
}

```
:::note[What's happening here?]
<Steps>
1. `test` script - Runs Jest with the specified configuration file. You can now run tests with `npm run test`
2. `jest` configuration - Specifies the preset and which folder Jest should look for tests in
</Steps>
:::

## Step 4: Create your first test - the `Task` component

Create a new folder called `tests` at the root of your project, and place a `Task.test.js` file in here:

<FileTree>
- lib/
- node_modules/
- **tests**
	- **Task.test.js**
- global.css
- index.js
</FileTree>

This will contain all the tests for the `Task` component

Add your first test code below to `Task.test.js`:

```diff lang="js" title="tests/Task.test.js"
import React from "react";
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react-native";
import Task from "../components/Task"; // Adjust path as needed

// Mock any components or contexts used by Task
jest.mock("~/lib/TaskContext", () => ({
  useTasks: () => ({
    updateTask: jest.fn(),
    deleteTask: jest.fn(),
  }),
}));

describe("Task", () => {
  test("renders a task", () => {
    const task = {
      id: 1,
      title: "Test Task",
      category: "Test Category",
      isChecked: false,
    };

    render(<Task task={task} />);

    // Just check if the title and category are displayed
    const titleElement = screen.getByText("Test Task");
    const categoryElement = screen.getByText("Test Category");
    expect(titleElement).toBeTruthy();
    expect(categoryElement).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

:::note[Understanding the Test]

<Steps>
1. **Imports**: We import `React`, testing utilities, and the component we want to test
2. **Mocks**: We mock the `TaskContext` to provide fake implementations of functions our component might use
3. **Test Structure**: - `describe` groups related tests - `test` (or `it`) defines a single test case
4. **Component Rendering**: We render the Task component with test props
5. **Assertions**: We check if the component displays the expected text
</Steps>

## What is `screen`?

The `screen` object provides methods to query the rendered component, similar to how a user would interact with your app:

<Steps>
1. `getByText`: Finds elements by their text content
2. `getByTestId`: Finds elements by their testID prop
</Steps>

And many more query methods!
:::

## Step 5: Run your test

Run your test with the command below:

```bash
npm run test
```

This will execute Jest with your configuration and run all tests matching the pattern in your testMatch configuration.

:::note[What to expect when running tests]
<Steps>
1. Jest will find all files inside the `tests` folder
2. It will run the tests in those files
3. It will report which tests passed or failed
4. For failed tests, it will show what was expected vs. what was received
</Steps>
:::

When you run the test, you should see a passing test for our `Task` component:

![Tests passing](src/assets/webp/react-native/tests-passing.webp)

## Step 6: Understanding Component Rendering Tests

The test we wrote in Step 4 is a basic component rendering test. It verifies that our component correctly displays the data it receives as props. This type of test is essential for ensuring your UI components render correctly.

However, real applications need more than just static rendering - they need to respond to user interactions!

## Step 7: Adding Interaction Tests

Let's enhance our test suite by adding an interaction test that verifies the checkbox in our Task component works correctly when pressed.

First, we need to add a `testID` to our checkbox component to make it easier to find in our tests:

```diff lang="tsx" title="components/Task.tsx"
<Checkbox
+  testID="checkbox"
  className="border-foreground checked:bg-foreground"
  checked={isChecked}
  onCheckedChange={handleSetChecked}
/>
```

Now, let's add a new test to our `Task.test.js` file that verifies the checkbox calls the correct function when pressed:

```diff lang="tsx" title="tests/Task.test.js" showLineNumbers collapse={1-12, 14-29}
import React from "react";
+import { render, screen, userEvent } from "@testing-library/react-native";
import Task from "../components/Task"; // Adjust path as needed

// Mock any components or contexts used by Task
jest.mock("~/lib/TaskContext", () => ({
  useTasks: () => ({
    updateTask: jest.fn(),
    deleteTask: jest.fn(),
  }),
}));

describe("Task", () => {
  test("renders a task", () => {
    const task = {
      id: 1,
      title: "Test Task",
      category: "Test Category",
      isChecked: false,
    };

    render(<Task task={task} />);

    // Just check if the title is displayed
    const titleElement = screen.getByText("Test Task");
    const categoryElement = screen.getByText("Test Category");
    expect(titleElement).toBeTruthy();
    expect(categoryElement).toBeTruthy();
  });

+  test("toggles completion status when pressed", async () => {
+    const mockToggle = jest.fn(); // Create a mock function
+    const task = {
+      id: 1,
+      title: "Test Task",
+      category: "Test Category",
+      isChecked: false,
+    };
+
+    render(<Task task={task} onUpdate={mockToggle} />);
+
+    const checkbox = screen.getByTestId("checkbox"); // Find the checkbox element
+
+    const user = userEvent.setup();
+    await user.press(checkbox);
+
+    // Check if our mock function was called
+    expect(mockToggle).toHaveBeenCalled();
+  });
});
```

:::note[Understanding Interaction Tests]
<Steps>
1. **Mock Functions**: We create a mock function (`jest.fn()`) that we can pass as a prop to track if and how it's called
2. **Finding Elements**: We use `getByTestId` to find elements with a specific `testID` prop
3. **Simulating Events**: We use `userEvent` to simulate user interactions like pressing a button
4. **Verifying Behavior**: We check if our mock function was called, indicating the component behaved as expected
</Steps>
:::

### What is `userEvent`?

The `userEvent` function allows you to simulate user interactions with your components.

These must always be placed inside an `async` function, because they use `await` internally.

<Steps>
1. `const userEvent = userEvent.setup();` - Sets up the user event simulation
2. `await user.press(checkbox);` - Simulates pressing/tapping an element
3. `await user.type(textInput, 'Hello world!');` - Simulates typing in a text input
4. You can find out more about `userEvent` in the [official documentation](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/api/events/user-event)
</Steps>

This is powerful because it lets you test not just what your component looks like, but how it responds to user input!

## Step 8: Testing More Complex Interactions

Now that we've covered the basics of interaction testing, let's explore how to test more complex scenarios:

## Step 9: Testing with More Specific Assertions

Our current test only verifies that the `onUpdate` function was called, but we can make our test more specific by checking exactly how it was called:

```diff lang="tsx" title="tests/Task.test.js" ins=", userEvent"
  import { render, screen, userEvent } from "@testing-library/react-native";

  // ... other imports and setup

  test("toggles completion status when pressed", async () => {
    const mockToggle = jest.fn();
    const task = {
      id: 1,
      title: "Test Task",
      category: "Test Category",
      isChecked: false,
    };

    render(<Task task={task} onUpdate={mockToggle} />);

    const checkbox = screen.getByTestId("checkbox");

    const user = userEvent.setup();
    await user.press(checkbox);

-   // Check if our mock function was called
-   expect(mockToggle).toHaveBeenCalled();
+   // Check if our mock function was called with the correct arguments
+   expect(mockToggle).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
+     ...task,
+     isChecked: true  // The checkbox should toggle from false to true
+   });
  });
```

## Step 10: Testing Multiple States

It's also important to test different starting states. Let's add another test for when the task is already checked:

```diff lang="tsx" title="tests/Task.test.js"
  test("toggles from checked to unchecked when pressed", async () => {
    const mockToggle = jest.fn();
    const task = {
      id: 1,
      title: "Test Task",
      category: "Test Category",
      isChecked: true, // Starting as checked
    };

    render(<Task task={task} onUpdate={mockToggle} />);

    const checkbox = screen.getByTestId("checkbox");

    const user = userEvent.setup();
    await user.press(checkbox);

    // Check if our mock function was called with the correct arguments
    expect(mockToggle).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      ...task,
      isChecked: false, // The checkbox should toggle from true to false
    });
  });
```

### Best Practices for Interaction Tests

When writing interaction tests, keep these principles in mind:

<Steps>
1. **Test user behavior, not implementation details**: Focus on what the user does and sees, not on internal component state or methods
2. **Use testIDs strategically**: Add testIDs to elements that need to be interacted with in tests
3. **Test edge cases**: Consider different starting states and user interactions
4. **Keep tests independent**: Each test should be able to run on its own without depending on other tests
5. **Mock external dependencies**: Use Jest's mocking capabilities to isolate the component you're testing
</Steps>

By following these practices, you'll create a robust test suite that gives you confidence in your application's behavior.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've learned how to:

<Steps>
1. Set up a testing environment for your React Native application
2. Write basic component rendering tests
3. Add testIDs to make components easier to find in tests
4. Create interaction tests that simulate user behavior
5. Use mock functions to verify component behavior
6. Apply best practices for writing effective tests
</Steps>

Testing is an essential part of building reliable applications. By investing time in writing good tests, you'll catch bugs earlier, make changes with confidence, and create a more maintainable codebase.

### Next Steps

To continue improving your testing skills:

<Steps>
1. Add tests for your other components
2. Learn about the full [React Native Testing Library API](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/)
3. See an example of a test using React Native Testing Library in the [official documentation](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/example-intro)
</Steps>

Remember, the goal of testing isn't 100% code coverage, but rather confidence that your application works as expected.

Focus on testing the most critical parts of your application first, and gradually expand your test suite as your application grows.
