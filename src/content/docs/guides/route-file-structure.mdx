## Nested routes in Remix

As we looked at in the [`Outlet` component lesson](src/content/docs/guides/outlet.mdx), Remix uses a file-based routing system. This means that the file structure of your project maps directly to the URL structure of your app.

But how does it map exactly? Let's take a look at the file structure of the Epic News app to see how it relates to the URL structure.

The Epic News app uses an NPM package called `remix-flat-routes` which you can read about in detail [here](https://github.com/kiliman/remix-flat-routes). Below is a summary of it's main naming conventions for mapping project files to URL routes:

- `_index.tsx` maps to `/` (or the base URL of the app - `http://localhost:3000/` in our case)
- Folders prefixed with an underscore (`_`) signify a parent route, e.g.

This graphic shows the relationship between file location and route URL in the Epic News app:
