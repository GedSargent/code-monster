## What is Svelte?

![Svelte - Modern JavaScript Framework](src/assets/svg/svelte/svelte-horizontal.svg)

Svelte is a modern web framework that makes building web applications simple and fun.

It is a component-based framework that allows you to build reusable components and compose them to create complex UIs.

## Create a new project

To create a new Svelte project, you can use the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) build tool.

<Steps>

1. **Install Node.js**

    If you don't have Node.js installed on your machine, you can download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

    Once you have Node.js installed, you can check the version by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

    You should see the version number of Node.js printed to the terminal.

2. Install the VS Code extension for Svelte

    Open VS Code and install the official [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) extension.

    This extension provides syntax highlighting, code completion, and other features for working with Svelte projects in VS Code.

2. **Create project folder**

    Open VS Code, go to 'Open Folder' and create a new folder for your project somewhere on your machine that won't sync to OneDrive or another cloud service.

3. **Open a terminal**

    Open a terminal in VS Code by pressing <MonsterKbd>Ctrl + ~</MonsterKbd> (Windows), <MonsterKbd>Ctrl + ~</MonsterKbd> (Mac) or by going to the 'Terminal' menu and selecting 'New Terminal'.

4. **Install project**

    Install a new Svelte project by running the command below in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npm init vite
    ```

</Steps>
